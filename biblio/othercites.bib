abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are very important in the function of a cell. Computational studies of these interactions have been of interest, but often they have utilized classical modelling techniques. In recent years, quantum mechanical (QM) treatment of entire proteins has emerged as a powerful approach to study biomolecular systems. Herein, we apply a semi-empirical divide and conquer (DC) methodology coupled with a dielectric continuum model for the solvent, to explore the contribution of electrostatics, polarization and charge transfer to the interaction energy between barnase and barstar in their complex form. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed to account for the dynamic behavior of the complex. The results show that electrostatics, charge transfer and polarization favor the formation of the complex. Our study shows that electrostatics dominates the interaction between barnase and barstar ( approximately 73{\%}), while charge transfer and polarization are approximately 21{\%} and approximately 6{\%}, respectively. Close inspection of the polarization and charge-transfer effects on the charge distribution of the complex reveals the existence of two, well localized, regions in barstar. The first region includes the residues between P27 and Y47 and the second region is between N65 and D83. Since no such regions could be detected in barnase clearly suggests that barstar is well optimized for efficiently binding barnase. Furthermore, using our interaction energy decomposition scheme, we were able to identify all residues that have been experimentally determined to be important for the complex formation and to suggest other residues never have been investigated. This suggests that our approach will be useful as an aid in further understanding protein-protein contacts for the ultimate goal to produce successful inhibitors for protein complexes.},

abstract = {Hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by adult-onset loss of the lower and upper motor neuron systems, often with involvement of other parts of the nervous system. Cases of hereditary ALS have been attributed to mutations in 12 different genes, the most common being SOD1, FUS and TARDBP-mutations in the other genes are rare. The identified genes explain 25-35{\%} of cases of familial ALS, but identifying the remaining genes has proved difficult. Only a few genes seem to account for significant numbers of ALS cases, with many others causing a few cases each. Hereditary ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, and families with low disease penetrance are frequently observed. In such families, the genetic predisposition may remain unnoticed, so many patients carry a diagnosis of isolated or sporadic ALS. The only clinical feature that distinguishes recognized hereditary from apparently sporadic ALS is a lower mean age of onset in the former. All the clinical features reported in hereditary cases (including signs of extrapyramidal, cerebellar or cognitive involvement) have also been observed in sporadic cases. Genetic counseling and risk assessment in relatives depend on establishing the specific gene defect and the disease penetrance in the particular family.},

Occasionally, specific mutations are associated with a particular phenotype. We evaluated a possible genotype-phenotype correlation and looked for a founder effect in nine patients from six unrelated families with ALS, all carrying the G41S mutation, originating from north-west Tuscany in central Italy. Mutational analysis of the SOD1 gene was carried out by direct sequencing. A haplotype study was carried out using eight polymorphic markers flanking the SOD1 gene. The clinical pattern of the nine familial ALS (FALS) patients was characterized by spinal onset with early upper and lower motor neuron involvement, appearance of bulbar signs within one year, and death a few months later. Mean age at onset was 49.3 years and mean duration of disease was 0.9 years. Genotyping revealed a common haplotype for the G41S allele...},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments have provided intriguing insights into the mechanical unfolding of proteins such as titin I27 from muscle, but will the same be possible for proteins that are not physiologically required to resist force? We report the results of AFM experiments on the forced unfolding of barnase in a chimeric construct with I27. Both modules are independently folded and stable in this construct and have the same thermodynamic and kinetic properties as the isolated proteins. I27 can be identified in the AFM traces based on its previous characterization, and distinct, irregular low-force peaks are observed for barnase. Molecular dynamics simulations of barnase unfolding also show that it unfolds at lower forces than proteins with mechanical function. The unfolding pathway involves the unraveling of the protein from the termini, with much more native-like secondary and tertiary structure being retained in the transition state than is observed in simulations of thermal unfolding or experimentally, using chemical denaturant. Our results suggest that proteins that are not selected for tensile strength may not resist force in the same way as those that are, and that proteins with similar unfolding rates in solution need not have comparable unfolding properties under force.},

abstract = {Copper, zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a ubiquitous homodimeric enzyme, whose misfolding and aggregation play a potentially key role in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). SOD1 aggregation is thought to be preceded by dimer dissociation and metal loss, but the mechanisms by which the metal-free monomer aggregates remain incompletely understood. Here we use implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo (MC) methods to investigate the local unfolding dynamics of the $\beta$-barrel-forming SOD1 monomer. Although event-to-event variations are large, on average, we find clear differences in dynamics among the eight strands forming the $\beta$-barrel. Most dynamic is the eighth strand, $\beta$8, which is located in the dimer interface of native SOD1. For the four strands in or near the dimer interface ($\beta$1, $\beta$2, $\beta$7, and $\beta$8), we perform aggregation simulations to assess the propensity of these chain segments to self-associate. We find that $\beta$1 and $\beta$2 readily self-associate to form intermolecular parallel $\beta$-sheets, whereas $\beta$8 shows a very low aggregation propensity.},

abstract = {The enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) is a ubiquitous oxireductase, which is responsible for the cellular defense against oxidative stress caused by the high toxicity of the superoxide radical, and has been also linked to some cases of familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the present study a set of molecular mechanics parameters for the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD has been derived. Afterward, an extensive molecular dynamics simulation has been carried out in an aqueous environment. The obtained results shed a further light on the structural flexibility of the backbone, where the active site is nested, and the solvation shell occupancy. The relatively small backbone deviation, shown by a root-mean-square deviation below 1.0 A, confirms the accuracy of the parameters. The solvent shell analysis has shown that the first solvation shell is located at about 5 A from the copper ion, generating an empty cavity with enough space to accommodate the superoxide radical. The low residence time means that a high permutation rate of water molecules in both solvation shells is consistent with the efficiency of this catalytic mechanism. Hybrid studies using ONIOM methodologies can now be done to evaluate the mechanistic implications of the explicit inclusion of the whole system.},

abstract = {Recently, it was reported that mutations in the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) are associated with X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and that both wild-type and mutant UBQLN2 can co-localize with aggregates of C-terminal fragments of TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Here, we describe a high affinity interaction between UBQLN2 and TDP-43 and demonstrate that overexpression of both UBQLN2 and TDP-43 reduces levels of both exogenous and endogenous TDP-43 in human H4 cells. UBQLN2 bound with high affinity to both full length TDP-43 and a C-terminal TDP-43 fragment (261–414 aa) with KD values of 6.2nM and 8.7nM, respectively. Both DNA oligonucleotides and 4-aminoquinolines, which bind to TDP-43, also inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43 with similar rank order affinities compared to inhibition of oligonucleotide binding to TDP-43. Inhibitor characterization experiments demonstrated that the DNA oligonucleotides noncompetitively inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, which is consistent with UBQLN2 binding to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. Interestingly, the 4-aminoquinolines were competitive inhibitors of UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, suggesting that these compounds also bind to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. In support of the biochemical data, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both TDP-43 and UBQLN2 interact in human neuroglioma H4 cells. Finally, overexpression of UBQLN2 in the presence of overexpressed full length TDP-43 or C-terminal TDP-43 (170–414) dramatically lowered levels of both full length TDP-43 and C-terminal TDP-43 fragments (CTFs). Consequently, these data suggest that UBQLN2 enhances the clearance of TDP-43 and TDP-43 CTFs and therefore may play a role in the development of TDP-43 associated neurotoxicity.},

abstract = {Recent studies identified rare missense mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients in the TARDBP gene encoding TAR DNA binding protein (TDP)-43, the major protein of the ubiquitinated inclusions (UBIs) found in affected motor neurons (MNs). The aim of this study was to further define the spectrum of TARDBP mutations in a large cohort of 666 Italian ALS patients (125 familial and 541 sporadic cases). The entire coding region was sequenced in 281 patients, while in the remaining 385 cases only exon 6 was sequenced. In 18 patients, of which six are familial, we identified 12 different heterozygous missense mutations (nine novel) all locating to exon 6, which were absent in 771 matched controls. The c.1144G{\textgreater}A (p.A382T) variation was observed in seven patients, thus representing the most frequent TARDBP mutation in ALS. Analysis of microsatellites surrounding the TARDBP gene indicated that p.A382T was inherited from a common ancestor in 5 of the 7 patients. Altogether, the frequency of TARDBP gene mutations appears to be particularly high in Italian ALS patients compared to individuals of mainly Northern European origin (2.7{\%} vs. 1{\%}). Western blot analysis of lymphocyte extracts from two patients carrying the p.A382T and p.S393L TARDBP mutations showed the presence of lower molecular weight TDP-43 bands, which were more abundant than observed in healthy controls and patients negative for TARDBP mutations. In conclusion, this report contributes to the demonstration of the causative role of the TARDBP gene in ALS pathogenesis and indicates that mutations may affect the stability of the protein even in nonneuronal tissues.

The work required to induce moderate structural deformations as a function of sequence index constitutes a "mechanical fingerprint" measuring structural rigidity in the native basin, from which we are able to unambiguously distinguish wild-type SOD1 from PTM variants and measure the severity of a given PTM on structural integrity. The cumulative distribution of work values provided a way to cleanly discriminate between SOD1 variants. Disulfide reduction destabilizes dimer stability more than the removal of either metal, but not moreso than the removal of both metals. Intriguingly, we found that disulfide reduction mechanically stabilizes apo-SOD1 monomer, underscoring the differences between native basin mechanical properties and equilibrium thermodynamic stabilities and elucidating the presence of internal stress in the apo state. All PTMs and ALS-associated mutants studied showed an increased tendency to lose either Cu or Zn and to monomerize - processes known to be critical in the progression of ALS. The valence of Cu strongly modulates its binding free energy. As well, several mutants were more susceptible to loss of metals and monomerization than the disulfide-reduced or apo forms of SOD1. Distance constraints are required to calculate free energies for metal binding and dimer separation, which are validated using thermodynamic cycles. When distance constraints are removed, the results agree with those obtained from direct application of the Jarzynski equality. ??2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Several families have been reported with autosomal-dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), genetically linked to chromosome 9p21. Here, we report an expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7{\%}) and familial ALS (23.5{\%}). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.},

abstract = {Many point mutations in human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder in heterozygotes. Here we show that these mutations cluster in protein regions influencing architectural integrity. Furthermore, crystal structures of SOD wild-type and FALS mutant H43R proteins uncover resulting local framework defects. Characterizations of beta-barrel (H43R) and dimer interface (A4V) FALS mutants reveal reduced stability and drastically increased aggregation propensity. Moreover, electron and atomic force microscopy indicate that these defects promote the formation of filamentous aggregates. The filaments resemble those seen in neurons of FALS patients and bind both Congo red and thioflavin T, suggesting the presence of amyloid-like, stacked beta-sheet interactions. These results support free-cysteine-independent aggregation of FALS mutant SOD as an integral part of FALS pathology. They furthermore provide a molecular basis for the single FALS disease phenotype resulting from mutations of diverse side-chains throughout the protein: many FALS mutations reduce structural integrity, lowering the energy barrier for fibrous aggregation.},

abstract = {Identification of mutations at familial loci for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has provided novel insights into the aetiology of this rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disease. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the more common (∼90{\%}) sporadic form have been less successful with the exception of the replicated locus at 9p21.2. To identify new loci associated with disease susceptibility, we have established the largest association study in ALS to date and undertaken a GWAS meta-analytical study combining 3959 newly genotyped Italian individuals (1982 cases and 1977 controls) collected by SLAGEN (Italian Consortium for the Genetics of ALS) together with samples from Netherlands, USA, UK, Sweden, Belgium, France, Ireland and Italy collected by ALSGEN (the International Consortium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics). We analysed a total of 13 225 individuals, 6100 cases and 7125 controls for almost 7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified a novel locus with genome-wide significance at 17q11.2 (rs34517613 with P = 1.11 × 10(-8); OR 0.82) that was validated when combined with genotype data from a replication cohort (P = 8.62 × 10(-9); OR 0.833) of 4656 individuals. Furthermore, we confirmed the previously reported association at 9p21.2 (rs3849943 with P = 7.69 × 10(-9); OR 1.16). Finally, we estimated the contribution of common variation to heritability of sporadic ALS as ∼12{\%} using a linear mixed model accounting for all SNPs. Our results provide an insight into the genetic structure of sporadic ALS, confirming that common variation contributes to risk and that sufficiently powered studies can identify novel susceptibility loci.},

Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

abstract = {Dominant mutations in Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), and aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been proposed to play a role in neurodegeneration. A growing body of evidence suggests that fALS-causing mutations destabilize the native structure of SOD1, leading to aberrant protein interactions for aggregation. SOD1 becomes stabilized and enzymatically active after copper and zinc binding and intramolecular disulfide formation, but it remains unknown which step(s) in the SOD1 maturation process is important in the pathological aggregation. In this study we have shown that apoSOD1 without disulfide is the most facile state for formation of amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. fALS mutations impair either zinc binding, disulfide formation, or both, leading to accumulation of the aggregation-prone, apo, and disulfide-reduced SOD1. Moreover, we have found that the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) facilitates maturation of SOD1 and that CCS overexpression ameliorates intracellular aggregation of mutant SOD1 in vivo. Based on our in vivo and in vitro results, we propose that facilitation of post-translational modifications is a promising strategy to reduce SOD1 aggregation in the cell.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that aggregation-prone proteins are both harmful and functional for a cell. How do cellular systems balance the detrimental and beneficial effect of protein aggregation? We reveal that aggregation-prone proteins are subject to differential transcriptional, translational, and degradation control compared to nonaggregation-prone proteins, which leads to their decreased synthesis, low abundance, and high turnover. Genetic modulators that enhance the aggregation phenotype are enriched in genes that influence expression homeostasis. Moreover, genes encoding aggregation-prone proteins are more likely to be harmful when overexpressed. The trends are evolutionarily conserved and suggest a strategy whereby cellular mechanisms specifically modulate the availability of aggregation-prone proteins to (1) keep concentrations below the critical ones required for aggregation and (2) shift the equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric/aggregate form, as explained by Le Chatelier's principle. This strategy may prevent formation of undesirable aggregates and keep functional assemblies/aggregates under control.},

abstract = {We have developed a computer algorithm, FOLDEF (for FOLD-X energy function), to provide a fast and quantitative estimation of the importance of the interactions contributing to the stability of proteins and protein complexes. The predictive power of FOLDEF was tested on a very large set of point mutants (1088 mutants) spanning most of the structural environments found in proteins. FOLDEF uses a full atomic description of the structure of the proteins. The different energy terms taken into account in FOLDEF have been weighted using empirical data obtained from protein engineering experiments. First, we considered a training database of 339 mutants in nine different proteins and optimised the set of parameters and weighting factors that best accounted for the changes in stability of the mutants. The predictive power of the method was then tested using a blind test mutant database of 667 mutants, as well as a database of 82 protein–protein complex mutants. The global correlation obtained for 95 {\%} of the entire mutant database (1030 mutants) is 0.83 with a standard deviation of 0.81kcalmol−1 and a slope of 0.76. The present energy function uses a minimum of computational resources and can therefore easily be used in protein design algorithms, and in the field of protein structure and folding pathways prediction where one requires a fast and accurate energy function.

Here we identify a molecular mechanism by which structural polymorphism of the HRE leads to ALS/FTD pathology and defects. The HRE forms DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with distinct structures and promotes RNA•DNA hybrids (R-loops). The structural polymorphism causes a repeat-length-dependent accumulation of transcripts aborted in the HRE region. These transcribed repeats bind to ribonucleoproteins in a conformation-dependent manner. Specifically, nucleolin, an essential nucleolar protein, preferentially binds the HRE G-quadruplex, and patient cells show evidence of nucleolar stress. Our results demonstrate that distinct C9orf72 HRE structural polymorphism at both DNA and RNA levels initiates molecular cascades leading to ALS/FTD pathologies, and provide the basis for a mechanistic model for repeat-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not well understood. Finland is a well suited location for a genome-wide association study of ALS because the incidence of the disease is one of the highest in the world, and because the genetic homogeneity of the Finnish population enhances the ability to detect risk loci. We aimed to identify genetic risk factors for ALS in the Finnish population. METHODS We did a genome-wide association study of Finnish patients with ALS and control individuals by use of Illumina genome-wide genotyping arrays. DNA was collected from patients who attended an ALS specialty clinic that receives referrals from neurologists throughout Finland. Control samples were from a population-based study of elderly Finnish individuals. Patients known to carry D90A alleles of the SOD1 gene (n=40) were included in the final analysis as positive controls to assess whether our genome-wide association study was able to detect an association signal at this locus. FINDINGS We obtained samples from 442 patients with ALS and 521 control individuals. After quality control filters were applied, 318 167 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 405 people with ALS and 497 control individuals were available for analysis. We identified two association peaks that exceeded genome-wide significance. One was located on chromosome 21q22 (rs13048019, p=2{\textperiodcentered}58×10(-8)), which corresponds to the autosomal recessive D90A allele of the SOD1 gene. The other was detected in a 232 kb block of linkage disequilibrium (rs3849942, p=9{\textperiodcentered}11×10(-11)) in a region of chromosome 9p that was previously identified in linkage studies of families with ALS. Within this region, we defined a 42-SNP haplotype that was associated with significantly increased risk of ALS (p=7{\textperiodcentered}47×10(-33) when people with familial ALS were compared with controls, odds ratio 21{\textperiodcentered}0, 95{\%} CI 11{\textperiodcentered}2-39{\textperiodcentered}1) and which overlapped with an association locus recently reported for frontotemporal dementia. For the 93 patients with familial ALS, the population attributable risk for the chromosome 9p21 locus was 37{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} CI 27{\textperiodcentered}7-48{\textperiodcentered}1) and that for D90A homozygosity was 25{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (16{\textperiodcentered}9-34{\textperiodcentered}1). INTERPRETATION The chromosome 9p21 locus is a major cause of familial ALS in the Finnish population. Our data suggest the presence of a founder mutation for chromosome 9p21-linked ALS. Furthermore, the overlap with the risk haplotype recently reported for frontotemporal dementia provides further evidence of a shared genetic cause for these two neurodegenerative diseases.

abstract = {In the 1960s, Christian Anfinsen postulated that the unique three-dimensional structure of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence. This work laid the foundation for the sequence–structure–function paradigm, which states that the sequence of a protein determines its structure, and structure determines function. However, a class of polypep-tide segments called intrinsically disordered regions does not conform to this postulate. In this review, I will first describe established and emerging ideas about how disordered regions contribute to protein function. I will then discuss molecular principles by which regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and asymmetric localization of tran-scripts that encode disordered regions, can increase the functional versatility of proteins. Finally, I will discuss how disordered regions contribute to human disease and the emergence of cellular complexity during organismal evolution.},

abstract = {Although the molecular determinants of Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FALS) are still largely unknown, previous studies have demonstrated that aggregation of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants may play a causative role in FALS. It has been proposed that this pathogenic process occurs via a multi-step pathway involving metal loss, dimer dissociation and assembly of misfolded apo-monomers. The G37R, one of the many SOD1 mutations known to be associated to FALS, is difficult to be reconciled with this model because it is located far from the metal sites and the monomer-monomer interface. Consequently, an inspection of all the steps involved in G37R SOD1 misfolding is expected to provide hints in the understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. To this aim, an array of different computational strategies--i.e. Thermodynamic Integration (TI), implicit solvent Constant Temperature Molecular Dynamics (CTMD) and Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD)--have been applied on the G37R SOD1 mutant. A comparison with parallel studies carried out for the Wild Type (WT) SOD1 pointed out that the mutation decreases the affinity of the protein for the Cu(ii) ion. Implicit solvents MD simulations performed on the two apo proteins revealed that in the mutant SOD1 a novel, stable H-bond network involving Arg37, Lys91, Lys36 and Leu38 is created thus confirming a pivotal role of this region in driving the biophysical properties of the entire protein. Finally, the presence of energetic "traps" in the force vs. elongation curves of G37R SOD1 is an indicator of the existence of intermediate states along the unfolding pathway which may lead to abnormal conformers. Our results support a general theory suggesting that the two major hypotheses regarding mutant SOD1 toxicity, i.e. aberrant copper redox chemistry and SOD1 misfolding are causally linked. In fact it is shown that the G37R mutation, although located far away the active site, may induce subtle modification in SOD1 leading to the loosening of metal binding and to the formation of metastable intermediate states along the unfolding pathway.},

abstract = {The millisecond time scale needed for molecular dynamics simulations to approach the quantitative study of protein folding is not yet routine. One approach to extend the simulation time scale is to perform long simulations on specialized and expensive supercomputers such as Anton. Ideally, however, folding simulations would be more economical while retaining reasonable accuracy, and provide feedback on structure, stability and function rapidly enough if partnered directly with experiment. Approaches to this problem typically involve varied compromises between accuracy, precision, and cost; the goal here is to address whether simple implicit solvent models have become sufficiently accurate for their weaknesses to be offset by their ability to rapidly provide much more precise conformational data as compared to explicit solvent. We demonstrate that our recently developed physics-based model performs well on this challenge, enabling accurate all-atom simulated folding for 16 of 17 proteins with a variety of sizes, secondary structure, and topologies. The simulations were carried out using the Amber software on inexpensive GPUs, providing ∼1 $\mu$s/day per GPU, and {\textgreater}2.5 ms data presented here. We also show that native conformations are preferred over misfolded structures for 14 of the 17 proteins. For the other 3, misfolded structures are thermodynamically preferred, suggesting opportunities for further improvement.},

abstract = {The generalized Born (GB) model is one of the fastest implicit solvent models and it has become widely adopted for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. This speed comes with tradeoffs, and many reports in the literature have pointed out weaknesses with GB models. Because the quality of a GB model is heavily affected by empirical parameters used in calculating solvation energy, in this work we have refit these parameters for GB-Neck, a recently developed GB model, in order to improve the accuracy of both the solvation energy and effective radii calculations. The data sets used for fitting are significantly larger than those used in the past. Comparing to other pairwise GB models like GB-OBC and the original GB-Neck, the new GB model (GB-Neck2) has better agreement to Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) in terms of reproducing solvation energies for a variety of systems ranging from peptides to proteins. Secondary structure preferences are also in much better agreement with those obtained from explicit solvent MD simulations. We also obtain near-quantitative reproduction of experimental structure and thermal stability profiles for several model peptides with varying secondary structure motifs. Extension to non-protein systems will be explored in the future.},

abstract = {Structure-based and physics-based coarse-grained molecular force fields have become attractive approaches to gain mechanistic insight into the function of large biomolecular assemblies. Here, we study how both approaches can be combined into a single representation, that we term ELNEDIN. In this representation an elastic network is used as a structural scaffold to describe and maintain the overall shape of a protein and a physics-based coarse-grained model (MARTINI-2.1) is used to describe both inter- and intramolecular interactions in the system. The results show that when used in molecular dynamics simulations ELNEDIN models can be built so that the resulting structural and dynamical properties of a protein, including its collective motions, are comparable to those obtained using atomistic protein models. We then evaluate the behavior of such models in (1) long, microsecond time-scale, simulations, (2) the modeling of very large macromolecular assemblies, a viral capsid, and (3) the study of a protein-protein association process, the reassembly of the ROP homodimer. The results for this series of tests indicate that ELNEDIN models allow microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to be carried out readily, that large biological entities such as the viral capsid of the cowpea mosaic virus can be stably modeled as assemblies of independent ELNEDIN models, and that ELNEDIN models show significant promise for modeling protein-protein association processes.},

Here, we present structures of the pathogenic SOD1 variants D124V and H80R, both of which demonstrate compromised zinc-binding sites. The disruption of the zinc-binding sites in H80R SOD1 leads to conformational changes in loop elements, permitting non-native SOD1−SOD1 interactions that mediate the assembly of these proteins into higher-order filamentous arrays. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that these SOD1 variants are more prone to monomerization than the wild-type enzyme. Although D124V and H80R SOD1 proteins appear to have fully functional copper-binding sites, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) and anomalous scattering X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that zinc (not copper) occupies the copper-binding sites in these variants.

abstract = {We present an analysis of trajectories from Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusional protein-protein encounter for the well-studied system of barnase and barstar. This analysis reveals details about the optimal association pathways, the regions of the encounter complex, possible differences of the pathways for dissociation and association, the coupling of translational and rotation motion, and the effect of mutations on the trajectories. We found that a small free-energy barrier divides the energetically most favorable region into a region of the encounter complex above the barnase binding interface and a region around a second energy minimum near the RNA binding loop. When entering the region of the encounter complex from the region near the RNA binding loop, barstar has to change its orientation to increase the electrostatic attraction between the proteins. By concentrating the analysis on the successful binding trajectories, we found that the region of the second minimum is not essential for the binding of barstar to barnase. Nevertheless, this region may be helpful to steer barstar into the region of the encounter complex. When applying the same analysis to several barnase mutants, we found that single mutations may drastically change the free-energy landscape and may significantly alter the population of the two minima. Therefore, certain protein-protein pairs may require careful adaptation of the positions of encounter and transition states when interpreting mutation effects on kinetic rates of association and/or dissociation.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction data phasing through molecular replacement (MR). Here we present ElN{\'{e}}mo, a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models for use in MR. Due to the 'rotation-translation-block' (RTB) approximation implemented in ElN{\'{e}}mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, ElN{\'{e}}mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations, such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements, distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the same (or a homologous) protein are available, ElN{\'{e}}mo identifies the normal modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement. The web server can be freely accessed at http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/elnemo/index.html.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease presenting as sporadic (sALS) or familial (fALS) forms. Even if the list of the genes underlining ALS greatly expanded, defects in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), encoding the copper/zinc SOD1, still remain a major cause of fALS and are likely involved also in apparently sporadic presentations. The pathogenesis of ALS is still unknown, but several lines of evidence indicate that the mitochondrial accumulation of mutant SOD1 is an important mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to motor neuron pathology and death. The intramitochondrial localization of mutant SOD1 is debated. Mutant SOD1 might accumulate inside the intermembrane space (IMS), overriding the physiological retention regulated by the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS). On the other hand, misfolded SOD1 might deposit onto the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), clumping the transport across mitochondrial membranes and engaging mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis. The elucidation of the mechanisms ruling SOD1 localization and misplacing might shed light on peculiar ALS features such as cell selectivity and late onset. More importantly, these studies might disclose novel targets for therapeutic intervention in familial ALS as well as non-genetic forms. Finally, pharmacological or genetic manipulation aimed to prevent or counteract the intracellular shifting of mutant SOD1 could be effective for other neurodegenerative disorders featuring the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD, SOD1 protein) is an abundant copper- and zinc-containing protein that is present in the cytosol, nucleus, peroxisomes, and mitochondrial intermembrane space of human cells. Its primary function is to act as an antioxidant enzyme, lowering the steady-state concentration of superoxide, but when mutated, it can also cause disease. Over 100 different mutations have been identified in the sod1 genes of patients diagnosed with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). These mutations result in a highly diverse group of mutant proteins, some of them very similar to and others enormously different from wild-type SOD1. Despite their differences in properties, each member of this diverse set of mutant proteins causes the same clinical disease, presenting a challenge in formulating hypotheses as to what causes SOD1-associated fALS. In this review, we draw together and summarize information from many laboratories about the characteristics of the i...},

abstract = {Precise control of protein turnover is essential for cellular homeostasis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is well established as a major regulator of protein degradation, but an understanding of how inherent structural features influence the lifetimes of proteins is lacking. We report that yeast, mouse, and human proteins with terminal or internal intrinsically disordered segments have significantly shorter half-lives than proteins without these features. The lengths of the disordered segments that affect protein half-life are compatible with the structure of the proteasome. Divergence in terminal and internal disordered segments in yeast proteins originating from gene duplication leads to significantly altered half-life. Many paralogs that are affected by such changes participate in signaling, where altered protein half-life will directly impact cellular processes and function. Thus, natural variation in the length and position of disordered segments may affect protein half-life and could serve as an underappreciated source of genetic variation with important phenotypic consequences.},

abstract = {The extracellular ribonuclease barnase and its intracellular inhibitor barstar bind fast and with high affinity. Although extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out on this system, it is unclear what the relative importance of different contributions to the high affinity is and whether binding can be improved through point mutations. In this work, we first applied Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic calculations to 65 barnase-barstar complexes with mutations in both barnase and barstar. The continuum electrostatic calculations with a van der Waals surface dielectric boundary definition result in the electrostatic interaction free energy providing the dominant contribution favoring barnase-barstar binding. The results show that the computed electrostatic binding free energy can be improved through mutations at W44/barstar and E73/barnase. Furthermore, the determinants of binding affinity were quantified by applying COMparative BINding Energy (COMBINE) analysis to derive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for the 65 complexes. The COMBINE QSAR model highlights approximately 20 interfacial residue pairs as responsible for most of the differences in binding affinity between the mutant complexes, mainly due to electrostatic interactions. Based on the COMBINE model, together with Brownian dynamics simulations to compute diffusional association rate constants, several mutants were designed to have higher binding affinities than the wild-type proteins.},

abstract = {The thermal stability of barnase has been studied using constant pressure and temperature (CPT) molecular dynamics at different temperatures. Barnase X-ray coordinates were obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB code:1rnb). Simulations were performed at 285, 295, 300, 335, 345, and 395 K in explicit water under periodic boundary conditions for 280 ps. For each simulation, conformations were saved every 0.2 ps. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated relative to the starting structure at 300 K and at time t = 0. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values were calculated relative to the average structure obtained from the 300K simulation. Both root mean square deviation and fluctuation analysis indicated the presence of discrete regions of hyper-sensitivity along the barnase polypeptide chain. These regions exhibited spikes in flexibility prior to any global structural changes. The specific changes in barnase backbone flexibility are accompanied by increased phi/psi angle fluctuations. These results suggest the presence of early denaturation sites or denaturation nuclei whose local structure is disrupted prior to global structure disruption. Identification of denaturation nuclei suggests that appropriate amino acid replacements at these sites may lead to the design and development of more stable barnase mutants. This strategy of identifying denaturation nuclei in protein structures may represent a first step in the design of more stable protein structures.},

Forty-nanosecond MD calculations provide a sizeable pool of conformational states yielding a neat agreement with experiments for the metal-loaded enzyme and an exploration of flexible polypeptide segments in the metal-free dimer. This flexibility leads to a discrepancy between SAXS and MD which can be resolved proficiently by partial protein metallation highlighting the potential of this approach for examining overall conformational protein dynamics.},

abstract = {NMR spectroscopy and computer simulations were used to examine changes in chemical shifts and in dynamics of the ribonuclease barnase that result upon binding to its natural inhibitor barstar. Although the spatial structures of free and bound barnase are very similar, binding results in changes of the dynamics of both fast side-chains, as revealed by (2)H relaxation measurements, and NMR chemical shifts in an extended beta-sheet that is located far from the binding interface. Both side-chain dynamics and chemical shifts are sensitive to variations in the ensemble populations of the inter-converting molecular states, which can escape direct structural observation. Molecular dynamics simulations of free barnase and barnase in complex with barstar, as well as a normal mode analysis of barnase using a Gaussian network model, reveal relatively rigid domains that are separated by the extended beta-sheet mentioned above. The observed changes in NMR parameters upon ligation can thus be rationalized in terms of changes in inter-domain dynamics and in populations of exchanging states, without measurable structural changes. This provides an alternative model for the propagation of a molecular response to ligand binding across a protein that is based exclusively on changes in dynamics.},
