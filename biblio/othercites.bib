abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments have provided intriguing insights into the mechanical unfolding of proteins such as titin I27 from muscle, but will the same be possible for proteins that are not physiologically required to resist force? We report the results of AFM experiments on the forced unfolding of barnase in a chimeric construct with I27. Both modules are independently folded and stable in this construct and have the same thermodynamic and kinetic properties as the isolated proteins. I27 can be identified in the AFM traces based on its previous characterization, and distinct, irregular low-force peaks are observed for barnase. Molecular dynamics simulations of barnase unfolding also show that it unfolds at lower forces than proteins with mechanical function. The unfolding pathway involves the unraveling of the protein from the termini, with much more native-like secondary and tertiary structure being retained in the transition state than is observed in simulations of thermal unfolding or experimentally, using chemical denaturant. Our results suggest that proteins that are not selected for tensile strength may not resist force in the same way as those that are, and that proteins with similar unfolding rates in solution need not have comparable unfolding properties under force.},

abstract = {We have developed a computer algorithm, FOLDEF (for FOLD-X energy function), to provide a fast and quantitative estimation of the importance of the interactions contributing to the stability of proteins and protein complexes. The predictive power of FOLDEF was tested on a very large set of point mutants (1088 mutants) spanning most of the structural environments found in proteins. FOLDEF uses a full atomic description of the structure of the proteins. The different energy terms taken into account in FOLDEF have been weighted using empirical data obtained from protein engineering experiments. First, we considered a training database of 339 mutants in nine different proteins and optimised the set of parameters and weighting factors that best accounted for the changes in stability of the mutants. The predictive power of the method was then tested using a blind test mutant database of 667 mutants, as well as a database of 82 protein–protein complex mutants. The global correlation obtained for 95 {\%} of the entire mutant database (1030 mutants) is 0.83 with a standard deviation of 0.81kcalmol−1 and a slope of 0.76. The present energy function uses a minimum of computational resources and can therefore easily be used in protein design algorithms, and in the field of protein structure and folding pathways prediction where one requires a fast and accurate energy function. FOLDEF is available via a web-interface at http://fold-x.embl-heidelberg.de},

Here we show that these mutations cluster in protein regions influencing architectural integrity. Furthermore, crystal structures of SOD wild-type and FALS mutant H43R proteins uncover resulting local framework defects. Characterizations of beta-barrel (H43R) and dimer interface (A4V) FALS mutants reveal reduced stability and drastically increased aggregation propensity. Moreover, electron and atomic force microscopy indicate that these defects promote the formation of filamentous aggregates. The filaments resemble those seen in neurons of FALS patients and bind both Congo red and thioflavin T, suggesting the presence of amyloid-like, stacked beta-sheet interactions. These results support free-cysteine-independent aggregation of FALS mutant SOD as an integral part of FALS pathology. They furthermore provide a molecular basis for the single FALS disease phenotype resulting from mutations of diverse side-chains throughout the protein: many FALS mutations reduce structural integrity, lowering the energy barrier for fibrous aggregation.},

The changes of the hydrated structures of the complexes caused by the mutations were localized around the mutational site, suggesting that difference in the binding free energy is closely correlated with difference in the local hydrated structure. Then, the averaged binding free energy was estimated at 4.4 kJmol−1 per water-mediated indirect interaction on the basis of the difference in hydrogen bonding network.},

abstract = {The extracellular ribonuclease barnase and its intracellular inhibitor barstar bind fast and with high affinity. Although extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out on this system, it is unclear what the relative importance of different contributions to the high affinity is and whether binding can be improved through point mutations. In this work, we first applied Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic calculations to 65 barnase-barstar complexes with mutations in both barnase and barstar. The continuum electrostatic calculations with a van der Waals surface dielectric boundary definition result in the electrostatic interaction free energy providing the dominant contribution favoring barnase-barstar binding. The results show that the computed electrostatic binding free energy can be improved through mutations at W44/barstar and E73/barnase. Furthermore, the determinants of binding affinity were quantified by applying COMparative BINding Energy (COMBINE) analysis to derive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for the 65 complexes. The COMBINE QSAR model highlights approximately 20 interfacial residue pairs as responsible for most of the differences in binding affinity between the mutant complexes, mainly due to electrostatic interactions. Based on the COMBINE model, together with Brownian dynamics simulations to compute diffusional association rate constants, several mutants were designed to have higher binding affinities than the wild-type proteins.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction data phasing through molecular replacement (MR). Here we present ElN{\'{e}}mo, a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models for use in MR. Due to the 'rotation-translation-block' (RTB) approximation implemented in ElN{\'{e}}mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, ElN{\'{e}}mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations, such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements, distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the same (or a homologous) protein are available, ElN{\'{e}}mo identifies the normal modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement.

Its primary function is to act as an antioxidant enzyme, lowering the steady-state concentration of superoxide, but when mutated, it can also cause disease. Over 100 different mutations have been identified in the sod1 genes of patients diagnosed with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). These mutations result in a highly diverse group of mutant proteins, some of them very similar to and others enormously different from wild-type SOD1. Despite their differences in properties, each member of this diverse set of mutant proteins causes the same clinical disease, presenting a challenge in formulating hypotheses as to what causes SOD1-associated fALS.

abstract = {The enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) is a ubiquitous oxireductase, which is responsible for the cellular defense against oxidative stress caused by the high toxicity of the superoxide radical, and has been also linked to some cases of familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the present study a set of molecular mechanics parameters for the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD has been derived. Afterward, an extensive molecular dynamics simulation has been carried out in an aqueous environment. The obtained results shed a further light on the structural flexibility of the backbone, where the active site is nested, and the solvation shell occupancy. The relatively small backbone deviation, shown by a root-mean-square deviation below 1.0 A, confirms the accuracy of the parameters. The solvent shell analysis has shown that the first solvation shell is located at about 5 A from the copper ion, generating an empty cavity with enough space to accommodate the superoxide radical. The low residence time means that a high permutation rate of water molecules in both solvation shells is consistent with the efficiency of this catalytic mechanism. Hybrid studies using ONIOM methodologies can now be done to evaluate the mechanistic implications of the explicit inclusion of the whole system.},

This analysis reveals details about the optimal association pathways, the regions of the encounter complex, possible differences of the pathways for dissociation and association, the coupling of translational and rotation motion, and the effect of mutations on the trajectories. We found that a small free-energy barrier divides the energetically most favorable region into a region of the encounter complex above the barnase binding interface and a region around a second energy minimum near the RNA binding loop. When entering the region of the encounter complex from the region near the RNA binding loop, barstar has to change its orientation to increase the electrostatic attraction between the proteins. By concentrating the analysis on the successful binding trajectories, we found that the region of the second minimum is not essential for the binding of barstar to barnase. Nevertheless, this region may be helpful to steer barstar into the region of the encounter complex. When applying the same analysis to several barnase mutants, we found that single mutations may drastically change the free-energy landscape and may significantly alter the population of the two minima. Therefore, certain protein-protein pairs may require careful adaptation of the positions of encounter and transition states when interpreting mutation effects on kinetic rates of association and/or dissociation.},

abstract = {The thermal stability of barnase has been studied using constant pressure and temperature (CPT) molecular dynamics at different temperatures. Barnase X-ray coordinates were obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB code:1rnb). Simulations were performed at 285, 295, 300, 335, 345, and 395 K in explicit water under periodic boundary conditions for 280 ps. For each simulation, conformations were saved every 0.2 ps. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated relative to the starting structure at 300 K and at time t = 0. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values were calculated relative to the average structure obtained from the 300K simulation. Both root mean square deviation and fluctuation analysis indicated the presence of discrete regions of hyper-sensitivity along the barnase polypeptide chain. These regions exhibited spikes in flexibility prior to any global structural changes. The specific changes in barnase backbone flexibility are accompanied by increased phi/psi angle fluctuations. These results suggest the presence of early denaturation sites or denaturation nuclei whose local structure is disrupted prior to global structure disruption. Identification of denaturation nuclei suggests that appropriate amino acid replacements at these sites may lead to the design and development of more stable barnase mutants. This strategy of identifying denaturation nuclei in protein structures may represent a first step in the design of more stable protein structures.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are very important in the function of a cell. Computational studies of these interactions have been of interest, but often they have utilized classical modelling techniques. In recent years, quantum mechanical (QM) treatment of entire proteins has emerged as a powerful approach to study biomolecular systems. Herein, we apply a semi-empirical divide and conquer (DC) methodology coupled with a dielectric continuum model for the solvent, to explore the contribution of electrostatics, polarization and charge transfer to the interaction energy between barnase and barstar in their complex form. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed to account for the dynamic behavior of the complex. The results show that electrostatics, charge transfer and polarization favor the formation of the complex. Our study shows that electrostatics dominates the interaction between barnase and barstar ( approximately 73{\%}), while charge transfer and polarization are approximately 21{\%} and approximately 6{\%}, respectively. Close inspection of the polarization and charge-transfer effects on the charge distribution of the complex reveals the existence of two, well localized, regions in barstar. The first region includes the residues between P27 and Y47 and the second region is between N65 and D83. Since no such regions could be detected in barnase clearly suggests that barstar is well optimized for efficiently binding barnase. Furthermore, using our interaction energy decomposition scheme, we were able to identify all residues that have been experimentally determined to be important for the complex formation and to suggest other residues never have been investigated. This suggests that our approach will be useful as an aid in further understanding protein-protein contacts for the ultimate goal to produce successful inhibitors for protein complexes.},

abstract = {Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

abstract = {NMR spectroscopy and computer simulations were used to examine changes in chemical shifts and in dynamics of the ribonuclease barnase that result upon binding to its natural inhibitor barstar. Although the spatial structures of free and bound barnase are very similar, binding results in changes of the dynamics of both fast side-chains, as revealed by (2)H relaxation measurements, and NMR chemical shifts in an extended beta-sheet that is located far from the binding interface. Both side-chain dynamics and chemical shifts are sensitive to variations in the ensemble populations of the inter-converting molecular states, which can escape direct structural observation. Molecular dynamics simulations of free barnase and barnase in complex with barstar, as well as a normal mode analysis of barnase using a Gaussian network model, reveal relatively rigid domains that are separated by the extended beta-sheet mentioned above. The observed changes in NMR parameters upon ligation can thus be rationalized in terms of changes in inter-domain dynamics and in populations of exchanging states, without measurable structural changes. This provides an alternative model for the propagation of a molecular response to ligand binding across a protein that is based exclusively on changes in dynamics.},

The function of TDP-43 in the nervous system is uncertain, and a mechanistic role in neurodegeneration remains speculative. We identified neighboring mutations in a highly conserved region of TARDBP in sporadic and familial ALS cases. TARDBPM337V segregated with disease within one kindred and a genome-wide scan confirmed that linkage was restricted to chromosome 1p36, which contains the TARDBP locus. Mutant forms of TDP-43 fragmented in vitro more readily than wild type and, in vivo, caused neural apoptosis and developmental delay in the chick embryo. Our evidence suggests a pathophysiological link between TDP-43 and ALS.},

abstract = {Dominant mutations in Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), and aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been proposed to play a role in neurodegeneration. A growing body of evidence suggests that fALS-causing mutations destabilize the native structure of SOD1, leading to aberrant protein interactions for aggregation. SOD1 becomes stabilized and enzymatically active after copper and zinc binding and intramolecular disulfide formation, but it remains unknown which step(s) in the SOD1 maturation process is important in the pathological aggregation. In this study we have shown that apoSOD1 without disulfide is the most facile state for formation of amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. fALS mutations impair either zinc binding, disulfide formation, or both, leading to accumulation of the aggregation-prone, apo, and disulfide-reduced SOD1. Moreover, we have found that the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) facilitates maturation of SOD1 and that CCS overexpression ameliorates intracellular aggregation of mutant SOD1 in vivo. Based on our in vivo and in vitro results, we propose that facilitation of post-translational modifications is a promising strategy to reduce SOD1 aggregation in the cell.},

abstract = {Structure-based and physics-based coarse-grained molecular force fields have become attractive approaches to gain mechanistic insight into the function of large biomolecular assemblies. Here, we study how both approaches can be combined into a single representation, that we term ELNEDIN. In this representation an elastic network is used as a structural scaffold to describe and maintain the overall shape of a protein and a physics-based coarse-grained model (MARTINI-2.1) is used to describe both inter- and intramolecular interactions in the system. The results show that when used in molecular dynamics simulations ELNEDIN models can be built so that the resulting structural and dynamical properties of a protein, including its collective motions, are comparable to those obtained using atomistic protein models. We then evaluate the behavior of such models in (1) long, microsecond time-scale, simulations, (2) the modeling of very large macromolecular assemblies, a viral capsid, and (3) the study of a protein-protein association process, the reassembly of the ROP homodimer. The results for this series of tests indicate that ELNEDIN models allow microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to be carried out readily, that large biological entities such as the viral capsid of the cowpea mosaic virus can be stably modeled as assemblies of independent ELNEDIN models, and that ELNEDIN models show significant promise for modeling protein-protein association processes.},

abstract = {Recent studies identified rare missense mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients in the TARDBP gene encoding TAR DNA binding protein (TDP)-43, the major protein of the ubiquitinated inclusions (UBIs) found in affected motor neurons (MNs). The aim of this study was to further define the spectrum of TARDBP mutations in a large cohort of 666 Italian ALS patients (125 familial and 541 sporadic cases). The entire coding region was sequenced in 281 patients, while in the remaining 385 cases only exon 6 was sequenced. In 18 patients, of which six are familial, we identified 12 different heterozygous missense mutations (nine novel) all locating to exon 6, which were absent in 771 matched controls. The c.1144G{\textgreater}A (p.A382T) variation was observed in seven patients, thus representing the most frequent TARDBP mutation in ALS. Analysis of microsatellites surrounding the TARDBP gene indicated that p.A382T was inherited from a common ancestor in 5 of the 7 patients. Altogether, the frequency of TARDBP gene mutations appears to be particularly high in Italian ALS patients compared to individuals of mainly Northern European origin (2.7{\%} vs. 1{\%}). Western blot analysis of lymphocyte extracts from two patients carrying the p.A382T and p.S393L TARDBP mutations showed the presence of lower molecular weight TDP-43 bands, which were more abundant than observed in healthy controls and patients negative for TARDBP mutations. In conclusion, this report contributes to the demonstration of the causative role of the TARDBP gene in ALS pathogenesis and indicates that mutations may affect the stability of the protein even in nonneuronal tissues.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not well understood. Finland is a well suited location for a genome-wide association study of ALS because the incidence of the disease is one of the highest in the world, and because the genetic homogeneity of the Finnish population enhances the ability to detect risk loci. We aimed to identify genetic risk factors for ALS in the Finnish population. METHODS We did a genome-wide association study of Finnish patients with ALS and control individuals by use of Illumina genome-wide genotyping arrays. DNA was collected from patients who attended an ALS specialty clinic that receives referrals from neurologists throughout Finland. Control samples were from a population-based study of elderly Finnish individuals. Patients known to carry D90A alleles of the SOD1 gene (n=40) were included in the final analysis as positive controls to assess whether our genome-wide association study was able to detect an association signal at this locus. FINDINGS We obtained samples from 442 patients with ALS and 521 control individuals. After quality control filters were applied, 318 167 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 405 people with ALS and 497 control individuals were available for analysis. We identified two association peaks that exceeded genome-wide significance. One was located on chromosome 21q22 (rs13048019, p=2{\textperiodcentered}58×10(-8)), which corresponds to the autosomal recessive D90A allele of the SOD1 gene. The other was detected in a 232 kb block of linkage disequilibrium (rs3849942, p=9{\textperiodcentered}11×10(-11)) in a region of chromosome 9p that was previously identified in linkage studies of families with ALS. Within this region, we defined a 42-SNP haplotype that was associated with significantly increased risk of ALS (p=7{\textperiodcentered}47×10(-33) when people with familial ALS were compared with controls, odds ratio 21{\textperiodcentered}0, 95{\%} CI 11{\textperiodcentered}2-39{\textperiodcentered}1) and which overlapped with an association locus recently reported for frontotemporal dementia. For the 93 patients with familial ALS, the population attributable risk for the chromosome 9p21 locus was 37{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} CI 27{\textperiodcentered}7-48{\textperiodcentered}1) and that for D90A homozygosity was 25{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (16{\textperiodcentered}9-34{\textperiodcentered}1). INTERPRETATION The chromosome 9p21 locus is a major cause of familial ALS in the Finnish population. Our data suggest the presence of a founder mutation for chromosome 9p21-linked ALS. Furthermore, the overlap with the risk haplotype recently reported for frontotemporal dementia provides further evidence of a shared genetic cause for these two neurodegenerative diseases.

Mutational analysis of the SOD1 gene was carried out by direct sequencing. A haplotype study was carried out using eight polymorphic markers flanking the SOD1 gene. The clinical pattern of the nine familial ALS (FALS) patients was characterized by spinal onset with early upper and lower motor neuron involvement, appearance of bulbar signs within one year, and death a few months later.

abstract = {Although the molecular determinants of Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FALS) are still largely unknown, previous studies have demonstrated that aggregation of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants may play a causative role in FALS. It has been proposed that this pathogenic process occurs via a multi-step pathway involving metal loss, dimer dissociation and assembly of misfolded apo-monomers. The G37R, one of the many SOD1 mutations known to be associated to FALS, is difficult to be reconciled with this model because it is located far from the metal sites and the monomer-monomer interface. Consequently, an inspection of all the steps involved in G37R SOD1 misfolding is expected to provide hints in the understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. To this aim, an array of different computational strategies--i.e. Thermodynamic Integration (TI), implicit solvent Constant Temperature Molecular Dynamics (CTMD) and Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD)--have been applied on the G37R SOD1 mutant. A comparison with parallel studies carried out for the Wild Type (WT) SOD1 pointed out that the mutation decreases the affinity of the protein for the Cu(ii) ion. Implicit solvents MD simulations performed on the two apo proteins revealed that in the mutant SOD1 a novel, stable H-bond network involving Arg37, Lys91, Lys36 and Leu38 is created thus confirming a pivotal role of this region in driving the biophysical properties of the entire protein. Finally, the presence of energetic "traps" in the force vs. elongation curves of G37R SOD1 is an indicator of the existence of intermediate states along the unfolding pathway which may lead to abnormal conformers. Our results support a general theory suggesting that the two major hypotheses regarding mutant SOD1 toxicity, i.e. aberrant copper redox chemistry and SOD1 misfolding are causally linked. In fact it is shown that the G37R mutation, although located far away the active site, may induce subtle modification in SOD1 leading to the loosening of metal binding and to the formation of metastable intermediate states along the unfolding pathway.},

abstract = {Mutations in human copper−zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause an inherited form of the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we present structures of the pathogenic SOD1 variants D124V and H80R, both of which demonstrate compromised zinc-binding sites. The disruption of the zinc-binding sites in H80R SOD1 leads to conformational changes in loop elements, permitting non-native SOD1−SOD1 interactions that mediate the assembly of these proteins into higher-order filamentous arrays. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that these SOD1 variants are more prone to monomerization than the wild-type enzyme. Although D124V and H80R SOD1 proteins appear to have fully functional copper-binding sites, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) and anomalous scattering X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that zinc (not copper) occupies the copper-binding sites in these variants. The absence of copper in these proteins, together with...},

abstract = {Hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by adult-onset loss of the lower and upper motor neuron systems, often with involvement of other parts of the nervous system. Cases of hereditary ALS have been attributed to mutations in 12 different genes, the most common being SOD1, FUS and TARDBP-mutations in the other genes are rare. The identified genes explain 25-35{\%} of cases of familial ALS, but identifying the remaining genes has proved difficult. Only a few genes seem to account for significant numbers of ALS cases, with many others causing a few cases each. Hereditary ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, and families with low disease penetrance are frequently observed. In such families, the genetic predisposition may remain unnoticed, so many patients carry a diagnosis of isolated or sporadic ALS. The only clinical feature that distinguishes recognized hereditary from apparently sporadic ALS is a lower mean age of onset in the former. All the clinical features reported in hereditary cases (including signs of extrapyramidal, cerebellar or cognitive involvement) have also been observed in sporadic cases. Genetic counseling and risk assessment in relatives depend on establishing the specific gene defect and the disease penetrance in the particular family.},

Here, we report an expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7{\%}) and familial ALS (23.5{\%}). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.},

We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0{\%} of familial ALS and 21.1{\%} of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87{\%} of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that aggregation-prone proteins are both harmful and functional for a cell. How do cellular systems balance the detrimental and beneficial effect of protein aggregation? We reveal that aggregation-prone proteins are subject to differential transcriptional, translational, and degradation control compared to nonaggregation-prone proteins, which leads to their decreased synthesis, low abundance, and high turnover. Genetic modulators that enhance the aggregation phenotype are enriched in genes that influence expression homeostasis. Moreover, genes encoding aggregation-prone proteins are more likely to be harmful when overexpressed. The trends are evolutionarily conserved and suggest a strategy whereby cellular mechanisms specifically modulate the availability of aggregation-prone proteins to (1) keep concentrations below the critical ones required for aggregation and (2) shift the equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric/aggregate form, as explained by Le Chatelier's principle. This strategy may prevent formation of undesirable aggregates and keep functional assemblies/aggregates under control.},

abstract = {Mutations and oxidative modification in the protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been implicated in the death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a presently incurable, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Here we employ steered, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent to investigate the significance of either mutations or post-translational modifications (PTMs) to SOD1 on metal affinity, dimer stability, and mechanical malleability. The work required to induce moderate structural deformations as a function of sequence index constitutes a "mechanical fingerprint" measuring structural rigidity in the native basin, from which we are able to unambiguously distinguish wild-type SOD1 from PTM variants and measure the severity of a given PTM on structural integrity. The cumulative distribution of work values provided a way to cleanly discriminate between SOD1 variants. Disulfide reduction destabilizes dimer stability more than the removal of either metal, but not moreso than the removal of both metals. Intriguingly, we found that disulfide reduction mechanically stabilizes apo-SOD1 monomer, underscoring the differences between native basin mechanical properties and equilibrium thermodynamic stabilities and elucidating the presence of internal stress in the apo state. All PTMs and ALS-associated mutants studied showed an increased tendency to lose either Cu or Zn and to monomerize - processes known to be critical in the progression of ALS. The valence of Cu strongly modulates its binding free energy. As well, several mutants were more susceptible to loss of metals and monomerization than the disulfide-reduced or apo forms of SOD1. Distance constraints are required to calculate free energies for metal binding and dimer separation, which are validated using thermodynamic cycles. When distance constraints are removed, the results agree with those obtained from direct application of the Jarzynski equality. ??2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, it was reported that mutations in the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) are associated with X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and that both wild-type and mutant UBQLN2 can co-localize with aggregates of C-terminal fragments of TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Here, we describe a high affinity interaction between UBQLN2 and TDP-43 and demonstrate that overexpression of both UBQLN2 and TDP-43 reduces levels of both exogenous and endogenous TDP-43 in human H4 cells. UBQLN2 bound with high affinity to both full length TDP-43 and a C-terminal TDP-43 fragment (261–414 aa) with KD values of 6.2nM and 8.7nM, respectively. Both DNA oligonucleotides and 4-aminoquinolines, which bind to TDP-43, also inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43 with similar rank order affinities compared to inhibition of oligonucleotide binding to TDP-43. Inhibitor characterization experiments demonstrated that the DNA oligonucleotides noncompetitively inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, which is consistent with UBQLN2 binding to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. Interestingly, the 4-aminoquinolines were competitive inhibitors of UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, suggesting that these compounds also bind to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. In support of the biochemical data, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both TDP-43 and UBQLN2 interact in human neuroglioma H4 cells. Finally, overexpression of UBQLN2 in the presence of overexpressed full length TDP-43 or C-terminal TDP-43 (170–414) dramatically lowered levels of both full length TDP-43 and C-terminal TDP-43 fragments (CTFs). Consequently, these data suggest that UBQLN2 enhances the clearance of TDP-43 and TDP-43 CTFs and therefore may play a role in the development of TDP-43 associated neurotoxicity.},

This speed comes with tradeoffs, and many reports in the literature have pointed out weaknesses with GB models. Because the quality of a GB model is heavily affected by empirical parameters used in calculating solvation energy, in this work we have refit these parameters for GB-Neck, a recently developed GB model, in order to improve the accuracy of both the solvation energy and effective radii calculations. The data sets used for fitting are significantly larger than those used in the past. Comparing to other pairwise GB models like GB-OBC and the original GB-Neck, the new GB model (GB-Neck2) has better agreement to Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) in terms of reproducing solvation energies for a variety of systems ranging from peptides to proteins. Secondary structure preferences are also in much better agreement with those obtained from explicit solvent MD simulations. We also obtain near-quantitative reproduction of experimental structure and thermal stability profiles for several model peptides with varying secondary structure motifs. Extension to non-protein systems will be explored in the future.},

Here we use implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo (MC) methods to investigate the local unfolding dynamics of the $\beta$-barrel-forming SOD1 monomer. Although event-to-event variations are large, on average, we find clear differences in dynamics among the eight strands forming the $\beta$-barrel. Most dynamic is the eighth strand, $\beta$8, which is located in the dimer interface of native SOD1. For the four strands in or near the dimer interface ($\beta$1, $\beta$2, $\beta$7, and $\beta$8), we perform aggregation simulations to assess the propensity of these chain segments to self-associate. We find that $\beta$1 and $\beta$2 readily self-associate to form intermolecular parallel $\beta$-sheets, whereas $\beta$8 shows a very low aggregation propensity.},

abstract = {The millisecond time scale needed for molecular dynamics simulations to approach the quantitative study of protein folding is not yet routine. One approach to extend the simulation time scale is to perform long simulations on specialized and expensive supercomputers such as Anton. Ideally, however, folding simulations would be more economical while retaining reasonable accuracy, and provide feedback on structure, stability and function rapidly enough if partnered directly with experiment. Approaches to this problem typically involve varied compromises between accuracy, precision, and cost; the goal here is to address whether simple implicit solvent models have become sufficiently accurate for their weaknesses to be offset by their ability to rapidly provide much more precise conformational data as compared to explicit solvent. We demonstrate that our recently developed physics-based model performs well on this challenge, enabling accurate all-atom simulated folding for 16 of 17 proteins with a variety of sizes, secondary structure, and topologies. The simulations were carried out using the Amber software on inexpensive GPUs, providing ∼1 $\mu$s/day per GPU, and {\textgreater}2.5 ms data presented here. We also show that native conformations are preferred over misfolded structures for 14 of the 17 proteins. For the other 3, misfolded structures are thermodynamically preferred, suggesting opportunities for further improvement.},

The ubiquitin-proteasome system is well established as a major regulator of protein degradation, but an understanding of how inherent structural features influence the lifetimes of proteins is lacking. We report that yeast, mouse, and human proteins with terminal or internal intrinsically disordered segments have significantly shorter half-lives than proteins without these features. The lengths of the disordered segments that affect protein half-life are compatible with the structure of the proteasome. Divergence in terminal and internal disordered segments in yeast proteins originating from gene duplication leads to significantly altered half-life. Many paralogs that are affected by such changes participate in signaling, where altered protein half-life will directly impact cellular processes and function. Thus, natural variation in the length and position of disordered segments may affect protein half-life and could serve as an underappreciated source of genetic variation with important phenotypic consequences.},

However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the more common (∼90{\%}) sporadic form have been less successful with the exception of the replicated locus at 9p21.2. To identify new loci associated with disease susceptibility, we have established the largest association study in ALS to date and undertaken a GWAS meta-analytical study combining 3959 newly genotyped Italian individuals (1982 cases and 1977 controls) collected by SLAGEN (Italian Consortium for the Genetics of ALS) together with samples from Netherlands, USA, UK, Sweden, Belgium, France, Ireland and Italy collected by ALSGEN (the International Consortium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetics). We analysed a total of 13 225 individuals, 6100 cases and 7125 controls for almost 7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified a novel locus with genome-wide significance at 17q11.2 (rs34517613 with P = 1.11 × 10(-8); OR 0.82) that was validated when combined with genotype data from a replication cohort (P = 8.62 × 10(-9); OR 0.833) of 4656 individuals. Furthermore, we confirmed the previously reported association at 9p21.2 (rs3849943 with P = 7.69 × 10(-9); OR 1.16). Finally, we estimated the contribution of common variation to heritability of sporadic ALS as ∼12{\%} using a linear mixed model accounting for all SNPs. Our results provide an insight into the genetic structure of sporadic ALS, confirming that common variation contributes to risk and that sufficiently powered studies can identify novel susceptibility loci.},

abstract = {A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE), (GGGGCC)n, in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here we identify a molecular mechanism by which structural polymorphism of the HRE leads to ALS/FTD pathology and defects. The HRE forms DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with distinct structures and promotes RNA•DNA hybrids (R-loops). The structural polymorphism causes a repeat-length-dependent accumulation of transcripts aborted in the HRE region. These transcribed repeats bind to ribonucleoproteins in a conformation-dependent manner. Specifically, nucleolin, an essential nucleolar protein, preferentially binds the HRE G-quadruplex, and patient cells show evidence of nucleolar stress. Our results demonstrate that distinct C9orf72 HRE structural polymorphism at both DNA and RNA levels initiates molecular cascades leading to ALS/FTD pathologies, and provide the basis for a mechanistic model for repeat-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Tafuri2015,
abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease presenting as sporadic (sALS) or familial (fALS) forms. Even if the list of the genes underlining ALS greatly expanded, defects in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), encoding the copper/zinc SOD1, still remain a major cause of fALS and are likely involved also in apparently sporadic presentations. The pathogenesis of ALS is still unknown, but several lines of evidence indicate that the mitochondrial accumulation of mutant SOD1 is an important mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to motor neuron pathology and death. The intramitochondrial localization of mutant SOD1 is debated. Mutant SOD1 might accumulate inside the intermembrane space (IMS), overriding the physiological retention regulated by the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS). On the other hand, misfolded SOD1 might deposit onto the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), clumping the transport across mitochondrial membranes and engaging mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis. The elucidation of the mechanisms ruling SOD1 localization and misplacing might shed light on peculiar ALS features such as cell selectivity and late onset. More importantly, these studies might disclose novel targets for therapeutic intervention in familial ALS as well as non-genetic forms. Finally, pharmacological or genetic manipulation aimed to prevent or counteract the intracellular shifting of mutant SOD1 could be effective for other neurodegenerative disorders featuring the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins.},

We report the results of a moderate-scale sequencing study aimed at increasing the number of genes known to contribute to predisposition for ALS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 2869 ALS patients and 6405 controls. Several known ALS genes were found to be associated, and TBK1 (the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) was identified as an ALS gene. TBK1 is known to bind to and phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in innate immunity and autophagy, including optineurin (OPTN) and p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome), both of which have also been implicated in ALS. These observations reveal a key role of the autophagic pathway in ALS and suggest specific targets for therapeutic intervention.},

This work laid the foundation for the sequence–structure–function paradigm, which states that the sequence of a protein determines its structure, and structure determines function. However, a class of polypep-tide segments called intrinsically disordered regions does not conform to this postulate. In this review, I will first describe established and emerging ideas about how disordered regions contribute to protein function. I will then discuss molecular principles by which regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and asymmetric localization of tran-scripts that encode disordered regions, can increase the functional versatility of proteins. Finally, I will discuss how disordered regions contribute to human disease and the emergence of cellular complexity during organismal evolution.},

abstract = {Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25 °C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal–Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

The standard approximate intervals based on maximum likelihood theory, , can be quite misleading. In practice, tricks based on transformations, bias corrections, and so forth, are often used to improve their accuracy. The bootstrap confidence intervals discussed in this article automatically incorporate such tricks without requiring the statistician to think them through for each new application, at the price of a considerable increase in computational effort. The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems. In addition to parametric families, bootstrap intervals are also developed for nonparametric situations.},

abstract = {A strategy, called alanine-scanning mutagenesis, was used to identify specific side chains in human growth hormone (hGH) that strongly modulate binding to the hGH receptor cloned from human liver. Single alanine mutations (62 in total) were introduced at every residue contained within the three discontinuous segments of hGH (residues 2 to 19, 54 to 74, and 167 to 191) that have been implicated in receptor recognition. The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the hGH receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the hGH receptor are altered in homologs of hGH (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the hGH receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type hGH, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. The alanine scan also identified at least one side chain, Glu174, that hindered binding because when it was mutated to alanine the receptor affinity increased by more than a factor of four.},

abstract = {The conformational stability and reversibility of unfolding of the human dimeric enzyme Cu Zn superoxide dismutase (HSOD) and the three mutant enzymes constructed by replacement of Cys6 by Ala and Cys111 by Ser, singly and in combination, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The differential scanning calorimetry profile of wild-type HSOD consists of two components, which probably represent the unfolding of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme, with denaturation temperatures (Tm) of 74.9 and 83.6 degrees C, approximately 7 degrees lower than those for bovine superoxide dismutase (BSOD). The conformational stabilities of the two components of the mutant HSOD's differ only slightly from those of the wild type (delta delta Gs of -0.2 to +0.8 kcal/mol of dimer), while replacement of the BSOD Cys6 by Ala is somewhat destabilizing (delta delta G of -0.7 to -1.3 kcal/mol of dimer). These small alterations in conformational stability do not correlate with the large increases in resistance to thermal inactivation following substitution of free Cys in both HSOD and BSOD (McRee, D.E., Redford, S.M., Getzoff, E.D., Lepock, J.R., Hallewell, R.A., and Tainer, J.A. (1990) J. Biol.

(1991) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet., submitted for publication). The reversibility of unfolding was determined by scanning part way through the profile, cooling, rescanning, and calculating the amount of protein irreversibly unfolded by the first scan. The order of reversibility at a constant level of unfolding is the same as the order of resistance to inactivation for both the HSOD and BSOD wild-type and mutant enzymes. Thus, the greater resistance to thermal inactivation of the superoxide dismutase enzymes with free Cys replaced by Ala or Ser is dominated by a greater resistance to irreversible unfolding and relatively unaffected by changes in conformational stability.},

They are also included in several molecular mechanics computer programs. In this work, a total of eight atomic solvation parametric sets has been employed to calculate the solvation contribution to the free energy of folding delta Gs for 17 proteins. A linear correlation between delta Gs and the number of residues in each protein was found for each ASP set. The calculations also revealed a great variety in the absolute value and in the sign of delta Gs values such that certain ASP sets predicted the unfolded state to be more stable than the folded, whereas others yield precisely the opposite. Further, the solvation contribution to the free energy of association of helix pairs and to the disassociation of loops (connection between secondary structural elements in proteins) from the protein tertiary structures were computed for each of the eight ASP sets and discrepancies were evident among them.},

Use of B‐splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {\AA} or less.},

Although features of progressive neurogenic muscular atrophy were common in patients of these families, patients of each family showed characteristic clinical features. FALS patients with the H46R mutation showed a benign clinical course and stereotype progression of muscular weakness and atrophy beginning from the legs. In FALS with the L84V mutation, while the clinical course of the disease was similar, the age at onset was younger in men than women. The patients with I104F showed wide ranges of age at onset and duration with ophthalmoparesis and sensory involvement in one patient. Those with the V148I mutation showed younger age at onset and variable first symptoms within the family. Although lower motor sign was evident in all cases, hyperreflexia varied from 0 to 100{\%} among patients with the different mutations, and the Babinski sign was not observed in any case. Bulbar palsy was frequent with I104F, but not with H46R. SOD activity of the red blood cells was severely reduced with I104F and V148I, but was slightly reduced with H46R. These results suggest that familial ALS with different mutations of the Cu/Zn SOD gene each showed clinical characteristics, and that genetic mutations and clinical features are well correlated in familial ALS.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is among the most dire neurological diseases. The essential clinical feature of the disorder is relentless, lethal paralysis, usually beginning in midadult years. The disease is caused by a slow, progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. It usually begins focally and then spreads. In most cases, there is concurrent involvement of corticospinal (upper) and spinal (lower) motor neurons, although in some instances the spinal motor neuron features predominate. Involvement of the spinal motor neurons produces muscle denervation of the affected muscles and fasciculations, followed by muscle atrophy. When corticospinal motor neurons degenerate, the weakness is accompanied by spasticity. The mean age at onset of ALS is 55 years; the mean duration is about 4 years. The incidence of new cases is approximately 1 per 100,000 population. The total number of cases is about 5 per 100,000 population. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 20,000 to 30,000 cases. About 10{\%} of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; familial and sporadic ALS are clinically indistinguishable.},

The mean age of onset was 45.5 +/- 8.9 years, and the mean duration of disease was 3.4 years. Forty-seven different mutations in SOD1 of FALS patients have been described worldwide. In North America, the ala4val mutation is the most common. In our patients, the ala4val mutation was associated with the most rapid progression of disease. The mean duration of disease was 1.0 +/- 0.4 years, which is significantly less than the mean duration of disease for FALS patients with mutations in SOD1 other than ala4val (p {\textless} 0.001). The duration of disease for the glu100gly mutation, 5.1 +/- 3.3 years, was significantly longer than the ala4val mutation (p {\textless} 0.001). We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the age of onset and duration of the disease for three groups of patients having mutations in SOD1: (1) ala4val; (2) glu100gly; and (3) ala4val, gly37arg, his43arg, gly85arg, gly93ala, glu100gly, leu106val, ile113thr, leu144phe, and val148gly, i.e., the entire patient population.

abstract = {The accurate and efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions is one of the challenging problems of molecular dynamics simulation. Truncation procedures such as switching or shifting energies or forces lead to artifacts and significantly reduced accuracy. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method is one approach to overcome these problems by providing a computationally efficient means of calculating all long-range electrostatic interactions in a periodic simulation box by use of fast Fourier transformation techniques. For the application of the PME method to the simulation of a protein with a net charge in aqueous solution, counterions are added to neutralize the system. The usual procedure is to add charge-balancing counterions close to charged residues to neutralize the protein surface. In the present article, we show that for MD simulation of a small protein of marginal stability, the YAP-WW domain, explicit modeling of 0.2 M ionic strength (in addition to the charge-balancing counterions) is necessary to maintain a stable protein structure. Without explicit ions throughout the periodic simulation box, the charge-balancing counterions on the protein surface diffuse away from the protein, resulting in destruction of the beta-sheet secondary structure of the WW domain.},

abstract = {Recent studies have pointed out the important role of local water structures in protein conformational stability. Here, we present an accurate and computationally effective way to estimate the free energy contribution of the simplest water structure motif--the water bridge. Based on the combination of empirical parameters for accessible protein surface area and the explicit consideration of all possible water bridges with the protein, we introduce an improved protein solvation model. We find that accounting for water bridge formation in our model is essential to understand the conformational behavior of polypeptides in water. The model formulation, in fact, does not depend on the polypeptide nature of the solute and is therefore applicable to other flexible biomolecules (i.e., DNAs, RNAs, polysaccharides, etc.).},

abstract = {Molecular simulations able to exactly represent solvated charged proteins are helpful in understanding protein dynamics, structure and function. In the present study we have used two different starting structures of papain (a typical, stable, globular protein of intermediate net charge) and different modeling procedures to evaluate some effects of counterions in simulations. A number of configurations have been generated and relaxed for each system by various combinations of constrained simulated annealing and molecular dynamics procedures, using the AMBER force field. The analysis of trajectories shows that the simulations of solvated proteins are moderately sensitive to the presence of counterions. However, this sensitivity is highly dependent on the starting model and different procedures of equilibration used. The neutralized systems tend to evince smaller root mean square deviations regardless of the system investigated and the simulation procedure used. The results of parameterized fitting of the simulated structures to the crystallographic data, giving quantitative measure of the total charge influence on the stability of various elements of the secondary structure, revealed a clear scatter of different reactions of various systems' secondary structures to counterions addition: some systems apparently were stabilized when neutralized, while the others were not. Thus, one cannot unequivocally state, despite consideration of specific simulation conditions, whether protein secondary structures are more stable when they have neutralized charges. This suggests that caution should be taken when claiming the stabilizing effect of counterions in simulations other than those involving small, unstable polypeptides or highly charged proteins.},

abstract = {In order for any biological system to function effectively, it is essential to avoid the inherent tendency of proteins to aggregate and form potentially harmful deposits. In each of the various pathological conditions associated with protein deposition, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, a specific peptide or protein that is normally soluble is deposited as insoluble aggregates generally referred to as amyloid. It is clear that the aggregation process is generally initiated from partially or completely unfolded forms of the peptides and proteins associated with each disease. Here we show that the intrinsic effects of specific mutations on the rates of aggregation of unfolded polypeptide chains can be correlated to a remarkable extent with changes in simple physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity and charge. This approach allows the pathogenic effects of mutations associated with known familial forms of protein deposition diseases to be rationalized, and more generally enables prediction of the effects of mutations on the aggregation propensity of any polypeptide chain.},

abstract = {Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) forms a crucial component of the cellular defence against oxidative stress. Zn-deficient wild-type and mutant human SOD1 have been implicated in the disease familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). We present here the crystal structures of holo and metal-deficient (apo) wild-type protein at 1.8{\AA} resolution. The P21 wild-type holo enzyme structure has nine independently refined dimers and these combine to form a “trimer of dimers” packing motif in each asymmetric unit. There is no significant asymmetry between the monomers in these dimers, in contrast to the subunit structures of the FALS G37R mutant of human SOD1 and in bovine Cu,Zn SOD. Metal-deficient apo SOD1 crystallizes with two dimers in the asymmetric unit and shows changes in the metal-binding sites and disorder in the Zn binding and electrostatic loops of one dimer, which is devoid of metals. The second dimer lacks Cu but has ∼20{\%} occupancy of the Zn site and remains structurally similar to wild-type SOD1. The apo protein forms a continuous, extended arrangement of $\beta$-barrels stacked up along the short crystallographic b-axis, while perpendicular to this axis, the constituent $\beta$-strands form a zig-zag array of filaments, the overall arrangement of which has a similarity to the common structure associated with amyloid-like fibrils.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since the discovery of mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) ten years ago, testing for SOD1 gene mutations has become a part of the investigation of patients with suspected motor neuron disease. We searched for novel SOD1 mutations and for clinical characteristics of patients with these mutations. METHODS: Analysis was made of patient files at the Neurogenetic DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. We also scrutinized available medical records and examined patients with the different SOD1 mutations. RESULTS: One hundred and forty eight (148) of 2045 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients carried a disease-associated mutation in the SOD1 gene. The most prevalent was the A4V missense mutation, found in 41{\%} of those patients. Sixteen novel exonic mutations (L8V, F20C, Q22L, H48R, T54R, S591, V87A, T88deltaTAD, A89T, V97M, S105deltaSL, V118L, D124G, G141X, G147R, 11515) were found, bringing the total number of SOD1 gene mutations in ALS to 105. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the SOD1 gene are found both in sporadic and familial ALS cases without any definite predilection for any part of the gene. A common structural denominator for the 16 novel mutations or previously reported mutations is not obvious. Similarly, the nature of the putative acquired toxic function of mutant SOD1 remains unresolved. We conclude that patients with SOD1 mutations may infrequently show symptoms and signs unrelated to the motor systems, sometimes obscuring the diagnosis of ALS.},

abstract = {Mutations in the SOD1 gene cause the autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). In spinal cord neurons of human FALS patients and in transgenic mice expressing these mutant proteins, aggregates containing FALS SOD1 are observed. Accumulation of SOD1 aggregates is believed to interfere with axonal transport, protein degradation and anti-apoptotic functions of the neuronal cellular machinery. Here we show that metal-deficient, pathogenic SOD1 mutant proteins crystallize in three different crystal forms, all of which reveal higher-order assemblies of aligned beta-sheets. Amyloid-like filaments and water-filled nanotubes arise through extensive interactions between loop and beta-barrel elements of neighboring mutant SOD1 molecules. In all cases, non-native conformational changes permit a gain of interaction between dimers that leads to higher-order arrays. Normal beta-sheet-containing proteins avoid such self-association by preventing their edge strands from making intermolecular interactions. Loss of this protection through conformational rearrangement in the metal-deficient enzyme could be a toxic property common to mutants of SOD1 linked to FALS.},

This work shows that a crucial factor in predicting and rationalizing protein-protein interfaces can be inferred by assessing the extent of intramolecular desolvation of backbone hydrogen bonds in monomeric structures. Our statistical analysis of native structures shows that, in the majority of soluble proteins, most backbone hydrogen bonds are thoroughly wrapped intramolecularly by nonpolar groups except for a few ones. These latter underwrapped hydrogen bonds may be dramatically stabilized by removal of water. This fact implies that packing defects are "sticky" in a way that decisively contributes to determining the binding sites for proteins, as an examination of numerous complexes demonstrates.},

We find that water-mediated interactions greatly complement direct interactions in discriminating against various types of trap interactions that model those present in the cell. We highlight the context dependent nature of knowledge-based binding potentials, as contrasted with the situation for autonomous folding. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the corresponding interaction matrixes, we rationalize the strength of the recognition signal for each combination of the contact type and reference trap states using the differential in the idealized "canonical" amino acid compositions of native and trap layers. The comparison of direct and water-mediated contact potential matrixes emphasizes the importance of partial solvation in stabilizing charged groups in the protein interfaces. Specific water-mediated interresidue interactions are expected to influence significantly the kinetics as well as thermodynamics of protein association.},

abstract = {Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) are associated with the fatal neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There is considerable evidence that mutant SOD has a gain of toxic function; however, the mechanism of this toxicity is not known. We report here that purified SOD forms aggregates in vitro under destabilizing solution conditions by a process involving a transition from small amorphous species to fibrils. The assembly process and the tinctorial and structural properties of the in vitro aggregates resemble those for aggregates observed in vivo. Furthermore, the familial ALS SOD mutations A4V, G93A, G93R, and E100G decrease protein stability, which correlates with an increase in the propensity of the mutants to form aggregates. These mutations also increase the rate of protein unfolding. Our results suggest three possible mechanisms for the increase in aggregation: (i) an increase in the equilibrium population of unfolded or of partially unfolded states, (ii) an increase in the rate of unfolding, and (iii) a decrease in the rate of folding. Our data support the hypothesis that the gain of toxic function for many different familial ALS-associated mutant SODs is a consequence of protein destabilization, which leads to an increase in the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic copper,zinc superoxide dismutases are remarkably stable dimeric proteins that maintain an intrasubunit disulfide bond in the reducing environment of the cytosol and are active under a variety of stringent denaturing conditions. The structural interplay of conserved disulfide bond and metal-site occupancy in human copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (hSOD1) is of increasing interest as these post-translational modifications are known to dramatically alter the catalytic chemistry, the subcellular localization, and the susceptibility of the protein to aggregation. Using biophysical methods, we find no significant change in the gross secondary or tertiary structure of the demetallated form upon reduction of the disulfide. Interestingly, reduction does lead to a dramatic change in the quaternary structure, decreasing the monomer-to-dimer equilibrium constant by at least four orders of magnitude. This reduced form of hSOD1 is monomeric, even at concentrations well above the physiological range. Either the addition of Zn(II) or the formation of the disulfide leads to a shift in equilibrium that favors the dimeric species, even at low protein concentrations (i.e. micromolar range). We conclude that only the most immature form of hSOD1, i.e. one without any post-translational modifications, favors the monomeric state under physiological conditions. This finding provides a basis for understanding the selectivity of mitochondrial SOD1 import and may be relevant to the toxic properties of mutant forms of hSOD1 that can cause the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases are increasingly being realized to have common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation. The aggregates usually consist of fibers containing misfolded protein with a beta-sheet conformation, termed amyloid. There is partial but not perfect overlap among the cells in which abnormal proteins are deposited and the cells that degenerate. The most likely explanation is that inclusions and other visible protein aggregates represent an end stage of a molecular cascade of several steps, and that earlier steps in the cascade may be more directly tied to pathogenesis than the inclusions themselves. For several diseases, genetic variants assist in explaining the pathogenesis of the more common sporadic forms and developing mouse and other models. There is now increased understanding of the pathways involved in protein aggregation, and some recent clues have emerged as to the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity. These are leading to approaches toward rational therapeutics.},

abstract = {Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause motor neuron death in about 3{\%} of ALS cases. While the wild-type (wt) protein is anti-apoptotic, mutant SOD1 promotes apoptosis. We now demonstrate that both wt and mutant SOD1 bind the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, providing evidence of a direct link between SOD1 and an apoptotic pathway. This interaction is evident in vitro and in vivo in mouse and human spinal cord. We also demonstrate that in mice and humans, Bcl-2 binds to high molecular weight SDS-resistant mutant SOD1 containing aggregates that are present in mitochondria from spinal cord but not liver. These findings provide new insights into the anti-apoptotic function of SOD1 and suggest that entrapment of Bcl-2 by large SOD1 aggregates may deplete motor neurons of this anti-apoptotic protein.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

abstract = {The His46Arg (H46R) mutant of human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is associated with an unusual, slowly progressing form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Here we describe in detail the crystal structures of pathogenic H46R SOD1 in the Zn-loaded (Zn-H46R) and metal-free (apo-H46R) forms. The Zn-H46R structure demonstrates a novel zinc coordination that involves only three of the usual four liganding residues, His 63, His 80, and Asp 83 together with a water molecule. In addition, the Asp 124 "secondary bridge" between the copper- and zinc-binding sites is disrupted, and the "electrostatic loop" and "zinc loop" elements are largely disordered. The apo-H46R structure exhibits partial disorder in the electrostatic and zinc loop elements in three of the four dimers in the asymmetric unit, while the fourth has ordered loops due to crystal packing interactions. In both structures, nonnative SOD1-SOD1 interactions lead to the formation of higher-order filamentous arrays. The disordered loop elements may increase the likelihood of protein aggregation in vivo, either with other H46R molecules or with other critical cellular components. Importantly, the binding of zinc is not sufficient to prevent the formation of nonnative interactions between pathogenic H46R molecules. The increased tendency to aggregate, even in the presence of Zn, arising from the loss of the secondary bridge is consistent with the observation of an increased abundance of hyaline inclusions in spinal motor neurons and supporting cells in H46R SOD1 transgenic rats.},

abstract = {More than 100 structurally diverse point mutations leading to aggregation in the dimeric enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Although SOD1 dimer dissociation is a known requirement for its aggregation, the common structural basis for diverse FALS mutations resulting in aggregation is not fully understood. In molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type SOD1 and three structurally diverse FALS mutants (A4V, G37R, and H46R), we find that a common effect of mutations on SOD1 dimer is the mutation-induced disruption of dynamic coupling between monomers. In the wild-type dimer, the principal coupled motion corresponds to a "breathing motion" of the monomers around an axis parallel to the dimer interface, and an opening-closing motion of the distal metal-binding loops. These coupled motions are disrupted in all three mutants independent of the mutation location. Loss of coupled motions in mutant dimers occurs with increased disruption of a key stabilizing structural element (the beta-plug) leading to the de-protection of edge strands. To rationalize disruption of coupling, which is independent of the effect of the mutation on global SOD1 stability, we analyze the residue-residue interaction network formed in SOD1. We find that the dimer interface and metal-binding loops, both involved in coupled motions, are regions of high connectivity in the network. Our results suggest that independent of the effect on protein stability, altered protein dynamics, due to long-range communication within its structure, may underlie the aggregation of mutant SOD1 in FALS.},

Several hypotheses for their toxicity involve the mis-metallation of the enzyme. We present atomic-resolution crystal structures and biophysical data for human SOD1 in three metallation states: Zn-Zn, Cu-Zn and as-isolated. These data represent the first atomic-resolution structures for human SOD1, the first structure of a reduced SOD1, and the first structure of a fully Zn-substituted SOD1 enzyme. Recombinantly expressed as-isolated SOD1 contains a mixture of Zn and Cu at the Cu-binding site. The Zn-Zn structure appears to be at least as stable as the correctly (Cu-Zn) metallated enzyme. These data raise the possibility that in a cellular environment with low availability of free copper, Zn-Zn may be the preferred metallation state of SOD1 prior to its interaction with the copper chaperone.},

Molecular dynamics simulations were employed in the study of dynamic features of charged and polar side chains of amino acid residues. The basic conclusion has been made: surface charged and polar side chains with high conformational mobility can form alternative hydrogen bonded (H-bonded) donor-acceptor pairs. The correlation between the quantitative content of alternative H-bonds per residue and the temperature of maximal thermostability of proteins has been found. The proposed mechanism of protein thermostabilization suggests continuous disruption of the primary H-bonds and formation of alternative ones, which maintain constant the enthalpy value in the native state and prevent a rapid increase of the conformational entropy with the rising temperature. The analysis of the results show that the more residues located in the N- and C-terminal regions and in the extended loops that are capable of forming alternative longer-range H-bonded pairs, the higher the protein thermostability.},

abstract = {Twenty percent of the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by mutations in the Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) through the gain of a toxic function. The nature of this toxic function of mutant SOD1 has remained largely unknown. Here we show that WT SOD1 not only hastens onset of the ALS phenotype but can also convert an unaffected phenotype to an ALS phenotype in mutant SOD1 transgenic mouse models. Further analyses of the single- and double-transgenic mice revealed that conversion of mutant SOD1 from a soluble form to an aggregated and detergent-insoluble form was associated with development of the ALS phenotype in transgenic mice. Conversion of WT SOD1 from a soluble form to an aggregated and insoluble form also correlates with exacerbation of the disease or conversion to a disease phenotype in double-transgenic mice. This conversion, observed in the mitochondrial fraction of the spinal cord, involved formation of insoluble SOD1 dimers and multimers that are crosslinked through intermolecular disulfide bonds via oxidation of cysteine residues in SOD1. Our data thus show a molecular mechanism by which SOD1, an important protein in cellular defense against free radicals, is converted to aggregated and apparently ALS-associated toxic dimers and multimers by redox processes. These findings provide evidence of direct links among oxidation, protein aggregation, mitochondrial damage, and SOD1-mediated ALS, with possible applications to the aging process and other late-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, rational therapy based on these observations can now be developed and tested.},

abstract = {The early observations on the rate-of-living theory by Max Rubner and the report by Gershman that oxygen free radicals exist in vivo culminated in the seminal proposal in the 1950s by Denham Harman that reactive oxygen species are a cause of aging (free radical theory of aging). The goal of this review is to analyze recent findings relevant in evaluating Harman's theory using experimental results as grouped by model organisms (i.e., invertebrate models and mice). In this regard, we have focused primarily on recent work involving genetic manipulations. Because the free radical theory of aging is not the only theorem proposed to explain the mechanism(s) involved in aging at the molecular level, we also discuss how this theory is related to other areas of research in biogerontology, specifically, telomere/cell senescence, genomic instability, and the mitochondrial hypothesis of aging. We also discuss where we think the free radical theory is headed. It is now possible to give at least a partial answer to the question whether oxidative stress determines life span as Harman posed so long ago. Based on studies to date, we argue that a tentative case for oxidative stress as a life-span determinant can be made in Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in mice argue for a role of oxidative stress in age-related disease, especially cancer; however, with regard to aging per se, the data either do not support or remain inconclusive on whether oxidative stress determines life span.},

abstract = {Mutations of the gene encoding Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause 20{\%} of the familial cases of the progressive neurodegenerative disease ALS. A growing body of evidence suggests that in familial ALS (FALS) it is the molecular behavior of the metal-depleted SOD1 dimer that leads to a gain of toxic properties by misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation. Structural studies have so far provided static snapshots on the behavior of the wild-type enzyme and some of the FALS mutants. New approaches are required to map out the structural trajectories of the molecule. Here, using our 1.15-A resolution structure of fully metallated human SOD1 and highly parallelized molecular dynamics code on a high-performance capability computer, we have undertaken molecular dynamics calculations to 4,000 ps to reveal the first stages of misfolding caused by metal deletion. Large spatial and temporal fluctuations of the "electrostatic" and "Zn-binding" loops adjacent to the metal-binding sites are observed in the apo-enzyme relative to the fully metallated dimer. These early misfolding events expose the beta-barrels of the dimer to the external environment, allowing close interactions with adjacent molecules. Protection of the beta-edge of the protein can be partially restored by incorporating a single Zn molecule per dimer. These calculations reveal an essential step in the formation of the experimentally observed self-aggregations of metal-depleted FALS mutant SOD1. This result also has implications for the role of demetallated wild-type SOD1 in sporadic cases of ALS, for which the molecular cause still remains undiscovered.},

abstract = {Mutations in the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through the gain of a toxic function; however, the nature of this toxic function remains largely unknown. Ubiquitylated aggregates of mutant SOD1 proteins in affected brain lesions are pathological hallmarks of the disease and are suggested to be involved in several proposed mechanisms of motor neuron death. Recent studies suggest that mutant SOD1 readily forms an incorrect disulfide bond upon mild oxidative stress in vitro, and the insoluble SOD1 aggregates in spinal cord of ALS model mice contain multimers cross-linked via intermolecular disulfide bonds. Here we show that a non-physiological intermolecular disulfide bond between cysteines at positions 6 and 111 of mutant SOD1 is important for high molecular weight aggregate formation, ubiquitylation, and neurotoxicity, all of which were dramatically reduced when the pertinent cysteines were replaced in mutant SOD1 expressed in Neuro-2a cells. Dorfin is a ubiquityl ligase that specifically binds familial ALS-linked mutant SOD1 and ubiquitylates it, thereby promoting its degradation. We found that Dorfin ubiquitylated mutant SOD1 by recognizing the Cys(6)- and Cys(111)-disulfide cross-linked form and targeted it for proteasomal degradation.},

abstract = {The nature of the "toxic gain of function" that results from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-, Parkinson-, and Alzheimer-related mutations is a matter of debate. As a result no adequate model of any neurodegenerative disease etiology exists. We demonstrate that two synergistic properties, namely, increased protein aggregation propensity (increased likelihood that an unfolded protein will aggregate) and decreased protein stability (increased likelihood that a protein will unfold), are central to ALS etiology. Taken together these properties account for 69{\%} of the variability in mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide-dismutase-linked familial ALS patient survival times. Aggregation is a concentration-dependent process, and spinal cord motor neurons have higher concentrations of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase than the surrounding cells. Protein aggregation therefore is expected to contribute to the selective vulnerability of motor neurons in familial ALS.},

@article{Ding2008,
abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in neuronal death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Each SOD1 monomer binds to 1 copper and 1 zinc ion and maintains its disulfide bond (Cys-57-Cys-146) in the reducing cytoplasm of cell. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that metal loss and/or disulfide reduction are important for initiating misfolding and aggregation of SOD1. To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD1 folding, we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide-reduced environments in computational simulations. We use all-atom discrete molecular dynamics for sampling. Our simulation results provide dynamical evidence to the stabilizing role of metal ions in both dimer and monomer SOD1. The disulfide bond anchors a loop (Glu-49 to Asn-53) that contributes to the dimer interface. The reduction of the disulfide bond in SOD1 with metal ions depleted results in a flexible Glu-49-Asn-53 loop, which, in turn, disrupts dimer formation. Interestingly, the disulfide bond reduction does not affect the thermostability of monomer SOD1 as significantly as the metal ions do. We further study the structural dynamics of metal-free SOD1 monomers, the precursor for aggregation, in simulations and find inhomogeneous local unfolding of beta-strands. The strands protected by the metal-binding and electrostatic loops are found to unfold first after metal loss, leading to a partially unfolded beta-sheet prone to aggregation. Our simulation study sheds light on the critical role of metals and disulfide bond in SOD1 folding and aggregation.},

@article{Cozzolino2008,
abstract = {Converging evidence indicates that aberrant aggregation of mutant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (mutSOD1) is strongly implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). MutSOD1 forms high molecular weight oligomers, which disappear under reducing conditions, both in neural tissues of FALS transgenic mice and in transfected cultured cells, indicating a role for aberrant intermolecular disulfide cross-linking in the oligomerization and aggregation process. To study the contribution of specific cysteines in the mechanism of aggregation, we mutated human SOD1 in each of its four cysteine residues and, using a cell transfection assay, analyzed the solubility and aggregation of those SOD1s. Our results suggest that the formation of mutSOD1 aggregates are the consequence of covalent disulfide cross-linking and non-covalent interactions. In particular, we found that the removal of Cys-111 strongly reduces the ability of a range of different FALS-associated mutSOD1s to form aggregates and impair cell viability in cultured NSC-34 cells. Moreover, the removal of Cys-111 impairs the ability of mutSOD1s to form disulfide cross-linking. Treatments that deplete the cellular pool of GSH exacerbate mutSOD1s insolubility, whereas an overload of intracellular GSH or overexpression of glutaredoxin-1, which specifically catalyzes the reduction of protein-SSG-mixed disulfides, significantly rescues mutSOD1s solubility. These data are consistent with the view that the redox environment influences the oligomerization/aggregation pathway of mutSOD1 and point to Cys-111 as a key mediator of this process.},

abstract = {Ribonuclease HII from hyperthermophile Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase HII) is a kinetically robust monomeric protein. The conformational stability and folding kinetics of Tk-RNase HII were measured for nine mutant proteins in which a buried larger hydrophobic side chain is replaced by a smaller one (Leu/Ile to Ala). The mutant proteins were destabilized by 8.9 to 22.0 kJ mol(-1) as compared with the wild-type protein. The removal of each -CH(2)- group burial decreased the stability by 5.1 kJ mol(-1) on average in the mutant proteins of Tk-RNase HII examined. This is comparable with the value of 5.3 kJ mol(-1) obtained from experiments for proteins from organisms growing at moderate temperature. We conclude that the hydrophobic residues buried inside protein molecules contribute to the stabilization of hyperthermophilic proteins to a similar extent as proteins at normal temperature. In the folding experiments, the mutant proteins of Tk-RNase HII examined exhibited faster unfolding compared with the wild-type protein. These results indicate that the buried hydrophobic residues strongly contribute to the kinetic robustness of Tk-RNase HII. This is the first report that provides a practical cause of slow unfolding of hyperthermostable proteins.},

abstract = {To date, 146 different mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been identified in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mean age of disease onset in patients inheriting mutations in SOD1 is 45-47 years of age. However, although the length of disease duration is highly variable, there are examples of consistent disease durations associated with specific mutations (e. g. A4V, less than 2 years). In the present study, we have used a large set of data from SOD1-associated ALS pedigrees to identify correlations between disease features and biochemical/biophysical properties of more than 30 different variants of mutant SOD1. Using a reliable cell culture assay, we show that all ALS-associated mutations in SOD1 increase the inherent aggregation propensity of the protein. However, the relative propensity to do so varied considerably among mutants. We were not able to explain the variation in aggregation rates by differences in known protein properties such as enzyme activity, protein thermostability, mutation position or degree of change in protein charge. Similarly, we were not able to explain variability in the duration of disease in SOD1-associated ALS pedigrees by these properties. However, we find that the majority of pedigrees in which patients exhibit reproducibly short disease durations are associated with mutations that show a high inherent propensity to induce aggregation of SOD1.},

Both normal and mutant types of SOD1 and ataxin-3 are degraded by the proteasome. It was recently reported that these two proteins are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mammalian gp78 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Here, we show that gp78 interacts with both SOD1 and ataxin-3. Overexpression of gp78 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of these two proteins, whereas knockdown of gp78 stabilizes them. Moreover, gp78 represses aggregate formation of mutant SOD1 and protect cells against mutant SOD1-induced cell death. Furthermore, gp78 is increased in cells transfected with these two mutant proteins as well as in ALS mice. Thus, our results suggest that gp78 functions in the regulation of SOD1 and ataxin-3 to target them for ERAD.},

abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of the metal-free form of WT human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and its familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS)-related mutants, T54R and I113T, were characterized both in solution, through NMR, and in the crystal, through X-ray diffraction. We found that all 3 X-ray structures show significant structural disorder in 2 loop regions that are, at variance, well defined in the fully-metalated structures. Interestingly, the apo state crystallizes only at low temperatures, whereas all 3 proteins in the metalated form crystallize at any temperature, suggesting that crystallization selects one of the most stable conformations among the manifold adopted by the apo form in solution. Indeed, NMR experiments show that the protein in solution is highly disordered, sampling a large range of conformations. The large conformational variability of the apo state allows the free reduced cysteine Cys-6 to become highly solvent accessible in solution, whereas it is essentially buried in the metalated state and the crystal structures. Such solvent accessibility, together with that of Cys-111, accounts for the tendency to oligomerization of the metal-free state. The present results suggest that the investigation of the solution state coupled with that of the crystal state can provide major insights into SOD1 pathway toward oligomerization in relation to fALS.},

abstract = {We have previously identified a novel mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase, MITOL, which is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and is involved in the control of mitochondrial dynamics. In this study, we examined whether MITOL eliminates misfolded proteins localized to mitochondria. Mutant superoxide dismutase1 (mSOD1), one of misfolded proteins, has been shown to localize in mitochondria and induce mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly involving in the onset and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We found that in the mitochondria, MITOL interacted with and ubiquitinated mSOD1 but not wild-type SOD1. In vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that MITOL directly ubiquitinates mSOD1. Cycloheximide-chase assay in the Neuro2a cells indicated that MITOL overexpression promoted mSOD1 degradation and suppressed both the mitochondrial accumulation of mSOD1 and mSOD1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Conversely, the overexpression of MITOL CS mutant and MITOL knockdown by specific siRNAs resulted in increased accumulation of mSOD1 in mitochondria, which enhanced mSOD1-induced ROS generation and cell death. Thus, our findings indicate that MITOL plays a protective role against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the mitochondrial accumulation of mSOD1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.},

In this review, we discuss the mechanism of aggregation of globular proteins under conditions in which they are initially folded. Although a conformational change of the native state is generally necessary to initiate aggregation, we show that a transition across the major energy barrier for unfolding is not essential and that aggregation may well be initiated from locally unfolded states that become accessible, for example, via thermal fluctuations occurring under physiological conditions. We review recent evidence on this topic and discuss its significance for understanding the onset and potential inhibition of protein aggregation in the context of diseases.},

abstract = {The structure and unfolding of metal-free (apo) human wild-type SOD1 and three pathogenic variants of SOD1 (A4V, G93R, and H48Q) that cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been studied with amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry. The results indicate that a significant proportion of each of these proteins exists in solution in a conformation in which some strands of the beta-barrel (i.e. beta2) are well protected from exchange at physiological temperature (37 degrees C), whereas other strands (i.e. beta3 and beta4) appear to be unprotected from hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Moreover, the thermal unfolding of these proteins does not result in the uniform incorporation of deuterium throughout the polypeptide but involves the local unfolding of different residues at different temperatures. Some regions of the proteins (i.e. the "Greek key" loop, residues 104-116) unfold at a significantly higher temperature than other regions (i.e. beta3 and beta4, residues 21-53). Together, these results show that human wild-type apo-SOD1 and variants have a partially unfolded beta-barrel at physiological temperature and unfold non-cooperatively.},

@article{Bystrom2010,
abstract = {In good accord with the protein aggregation hypothesis for neurodegenerative diseases, ALS-associated SOD1 mutations are found to reduce structural stability or net repulsive charge. Moreover there are weak indications that the ALS disease progression rate is correlated with the degree of mutational impact on the apoSOD1 structure. A bottleneck for obtaining more conclusive information about these structure-disease relationships, however, is the large intrinsic variability in patient survival times and insufficient disease statistics for the majority of ALS-provoking mutations. As an alternative test of the structure-disease relationship we focus here on the SOD1 mutations that appear to be outliers in the data set. The results identify several ALS-provoking mutations whose only effect on apoSOD1 is the elimination or introduction of a single charge, i.e. D76V/Y, D101N, and N139D/K. The thermodynamic stability and folding behavior of these mutants are indistinguishable from the wild-type control. Moreover, D101N is an outlier in the plot of stability loss versus patient survival time by having rapid disease progression. Common to the identified mutations is that they truncate conserved salt-links and/or H-bond networks in the functional loops IV or VII. The results show that the local impact of ALS-associated mutations on the SOD1 molecule can sometimes overrun their global effects on apo-state stability and net repulsive charge, and point at the analysis of property outliers as an efficient strategy for mapping out new ALS-provoking features.},

To assess the abilities of some current models to capture these differences, we report here the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations examining the association of acetate?methylammonium and methane?methane pairs at 11 different temperatures from ?12.5 to 112.5 °C. Simulations were performed using two popular water models (TIP3P and TIP5P), with a total simulation time of 22 ?s. With both water models, we find that the acetate?methylammonium salt-bridge interaction is significantly more stabilized by high temperatures (e.g., over the range 25 to 100 °C) than is the methane?methane hydrophobic interaction. At low temperatures however, the two models exhibit quite different behavior, with the TIP5P model predicting little change in the relative stabilities of the two types of interaction in the range ?12.5 to 50 °C; this surprising result has potential implications for understanding adaptation to life in psychrophilic organisms. Fitting the ?G data to the Gibbs?Helmholtz equation allows the ?H, ?S, and ?Cp of interaction to be obtained, thereby yielding a complete thermodynamic characterization of the different types of interaction in the temperature range 0 to 100 °C: despite significant quantitative differences, both water models correctly capture the opposite signs of the ?Cp of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we show that at high temperatures a Poisson-based continuum solvation model provides good agreement with the explicit-solvent MD results, but only when the atomic radii used in the continuum calculations are scaled with temperature.

Based on this approach, we developed the DrugScore(PPI) webserver. The input consists of a protein-protein complex structure; the output is a summary table and bar plot of binding free energy differences for wild-type residue-to-Ala mutations. The results of the analysis are mapped on the protein-protein complex structure and visualized using J mol. A single interface can be analyzed within a few minutes.

Using a conformation-specific antibody that detects misfolded SOD1 (C4F6), we found that oxidized wild-type SOD1 and mutant SOD1 share a conformational epitope that is not present in normal wild-type SOD1. In a subset of human sporadic ALS (SALS) cases, motor neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord were markedly C4F6 immunoreactive, indicating that an aberrant wild-type SOD1 species was present. Recombinant, oxidized wild-type SOD1 and wild-type SOD1 immunopurified from SALS tissues inhibited kinesin-based fast axonal transport in a manner similar to that of FALS-linked mutant SOD1. Our findings suggest that wild-type SOD1 can be pathogenic in SALS and identify an SOD1-dependent pathogenic mechanism common to FALS and SALS.},

These include Zn bound to CCCC, CCCH, CCHH, CHHH, HHHH, HHHO, HHOO, HOOO, HHHD, and HHDD (O = water and the remaining are 1-letter amino acid codes). Bond and angle force constants and RESP charges were obtained from B3LYP/6-31G* calculations of model structures from the various primary shell combinations. MCPB and ZAFF can be used to create FFs for MD simulations of metalloproteins to study enzyme catalysis, drug design, and metalloprotein crystal refinement.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a conformational disease in which misfolding and aggregation of proteins such as SOD1 (familial ALS) and TDP-43 (sporadic ALS) are central features. The conformations adopted by such proteins within motor neurons in affected patients are not well known. We have developed a novel conformation-specific antibody (USOD) targeted against SOD1 residues 42-48 that specifically recognizes SOD1 in which the beta barrel is unfolded. Use of this antibody, in conjunction with the previously described SEDI antibody that recognizes the SOD1 dimer interface, allows a detailed investigation of the in vivo conformation of SOD1 at the residue-specific level. USOD and SEDI immunohistochemistry of spinal cord sections from ALS cases resulting from SOD1 mutations (A4V and DeltaG27/P28) shows that inclusions within remaining motor neurons contain SOD1 with both an unfolded beta barrel and a disrupted dimer interface. Misfolded SOD1 can also be immunoprecipitated from spinal cord extracts of these cases using USOD. However, in ten cases of sporadic ALS, misfolded SOD1 is not detected by either immunohistochemistry or immunoprecipitation. Using the amyloid-specific dyes, Congo Red and Thioflavin S, we find that SOD1-positive inclusions in familial ALS, as well as TDP-43- and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in sporadic ALS, contain non-amyloid protein deposits. We conclude that SOD1 misfolding is not a feature of sporadic ALS, and that both SOD1-ALS and sporadic ALS, rather than being amyloid diseases, are conformational diseases that involve amorphous aggregation of misfolded protein. This knowledge will provide new insights into subcellular events that cause misfolding, aggregation and toxicity.},

abstract = {We probe the hypothesis of corresponding states, according to which homologues from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms are in corresponding states of similar rigidity and flexibility at their respective optimal temperatures. For this, the local distribution of flexible and rigid regions in 19 pairs of homologous proteins from meso- and thermophilic organisms is analyzed and related to activity characteristics of the enzymes by constraint network analysis (CNA). Two pairs of enzymes are considered in more detail: 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase and thermolysin-like protease. By comparing microscopic stability features of homologues with the help of stability maps, introduced for the first time, we show that adaptive mutations in enzymes from thermophilic organisms maintain the balance between overall rigidity, important for thermostability, and local flexibility, important for activity, at the appropriate working temperature. Thermophilic adaptation in general leads to an increase of structural rigidity but conserves the distribution of functionally important flexible regions between homologues. This finding provides direct evidence for the hypothesis of corresponding states. CNA thereby implicitly captures and unifies many different mechanisms that contribute to increased thermostability and to activity at high temperatures. This allows to qualitatively relate changes in the flexibility of active site regions, induced either by a temperature change or by the introduction of mutations, to experimentally observed losses of the enzyme function. As for applications, the results demonstrate that exploiting the principle of corresponding states not only allows for successful thermostability optimization but also for guiding experiments in order to improve enzyme activity in protein engineering.},

abstract = {Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where aggregation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in causing neurodegeneration. Recent studies have suggested that destabilization and aggregation of the most immature form of SOD1, the disulfide-reduced, unmetallated (apo) protein is particularly important in causing ALS. We report herein in depth analyses of the effects of chemically and structurally diverse ALS-associated mutations on the stability and aggregation of reduced apo SOD1. In contrast with previous studies, we find that various reduced apo SOD1 mutants undergo highly reversible thermal denaturation with little aggregation, enabling quantitative thermodynamic stability analyses. In the absence of ALS-associated mutations, reduced apo SOD1 is marginally stable but predominantly folded. Mutations generally result in slight decreases to substantial increases in the fraction of unfolded protein. Calorimetry, ultracentrifugation, and light scattering show that all mutations enhance aggregation propensity, with the effects varying widely, from subtle increases in most cases, to pronounced formation of 40-100 nm soluble aggregates by A4V, a mutation that is associated with particularly short disease duration. Interestingly, although there is a correlation between observed aggregation and stability, there is minimal to no correlation between observed aggregation, predicted aggregation propensity, and disease characteristics. These findings suggest that reduced apo SOD1 does not play a dominant role in modulating disease. Rather, additional and/or multiple forms of SOD1 and additional biophysical and biological factors are needed to account for the toxicity of mutant SOD1 in ALS.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease, with astrocytes implicated as contributing substantially to motor neuron death in familial (F)ALS. However, the proposed role of astrocytes in the pathology of ALS derives in part from rodent models of FALS based upon dominant mutations within the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, which account for {\textless}2{\%} of all ALS cases. Their role in sporadic (S)ALS, which affects {\textgreater}90{\%} of ALS patients, remains to be established. Using astrocytes generated from postmortem tissue from both FALS and SALS patients, we show that astrocytes derived from both patient groups are similarly toxic to motor neurons. We also demonstrate that SOD1 is a viable target for SALS, as its knockdown significantly attenuates astrocyte-mediated toxicity toward motor neurons. Our data highlight astrocytes as a non-cell autonomous component in SALS and provide an in vitro model system to investigate common disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapies for SALS and FALS.},

NMR spectroscopy can probe hydrogen bond deformations at very high resolution through hydrogen bond scalar couplings (HBCs). However, the small size of HBCs has so far prevented a comprehensive quantitative characterization of protein hydrogen bonds as a function of the basic thermodynamic parameters of pressure and temperature. Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure- and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually unaffected. The specific stabilization of such topologically important connections may present a general principle with which to achieve protein stability and to preserve structural integrity during protein function.},

abstract = {Oxidative damage is a common and early feature of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative disorders. Dr. Mark Smith and his colleagues have built the case for oxidative stress being a primary progenitor rather than a secondary end-stage epiphenomenon of neurodegeneration. They proposed that reactive oxygen species contribute to the "age-related cascade of neurodegeneration," whereby accumulative oxidative damage with age promotes other characteristic pathological changes in afflicted brain regions, including protein aggregation, metabolic deficiencies, and inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) likely plays a critical role in this age-related cascade. NO is a major signaling molecule produced in the central nervous system to modulate neurological activity through stimulating cyclic GMP synthesis. However, the same physiological concentrations of NO, relevant in cellular signaling, may also initiate and amplify oxidative damage by diffusion-limited reactions with superoxide (O(2)(•-)) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). This is perhaps best illustrated in ALS where physiological levels of NO promote survival of motor neurons, but the same concentrations can stimulate motor neuron apoptosis and glial cell activation under pathological conditions. While these changes represent a complex mechanism involving multiple cell types in the pathogenesis of ALS, they also reveal general processes underlying neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic stability of a protein at elevated temperatures is a key factor for thermostable enzymes to catalyze their specific reactions. Yet our understanding of biological determinants of thermostability is far from complete. Many different atomistic factors have been suggested as possible means for such proteins to preserve their activity at high temperatures. Among these factors are specific local interatomic interactions or enrichment of specific amino acid types. The case of glycosyl hydrolase family endoglucanase of Trichoderma reesei defies current hypotheses for thermostability because a single mutation far from the active site (A35 V) converts this mesostable protein into a thermostable protein without significant change in the protein structure. This substantial change in enzymatic activity cannot be explained on the basis of local intramolecular interactions alone. Here we present a more global view of the induced thermostability and show that the A35 V mutation affects the underlying structural rigidity of the whole protein via a number of long-range, non-local interactions. Our analysis of this structure reveals a precisely tuned, rigid network of atomic interactions. This cooperative, allosteric effect promotes the transformation of this mesostable protein into a thermostable one.},

A subset of ALS cases is caused by mutations in the gene for Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which impart a toxic gain of function to this antioxidant enzyme. This neurotoxic property is widely believed to stem from an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate caused by decreased stability of the native homodimer or a tendency to lose stabilizing posttranslational modifications. Study of the molecular mechanisms of SOD1-related ALS has revealed a complex array of interconnected pathological processes, including glutamate excitotoxicity, dysregulation of neurotrophic factors and axon guidance proteins, axonal transport defects, mitochondrial dysfunction, deficient protein quality control, and aberrant RNA processing. Many of these pathologies are directly exacerbated by misfolded and aggregated SOD1 and/or cytosolic calcium overload, suggesting the primacy of these events in disease etiology and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.},

It is not known how the mutant protein causes disease, or why only a subset of cell types (motor neurons) are targeted. The aggregation and misfolding of mutant SOD1 are implicated in disease pathogenesis in both animal models and humans. We used a monoclonal antibody, C4F6, which specifically reacts with mutant and/or "misfolded" SOD1, to investigate the regional distribution of mutant SOD1 protein in rodent and human tissues. C4F6 reacted only with mutant SOD1 and showed remarkable selectivity for disease-affected tissues and cells. Tissue not affected by disease but containing high levels of mutant protein (sensory neurons) did not stain with C4F6. Additionally, C4F6 intensely stained some motor neurons while leaving adjacent motor neurons unstained. Although C4F6 was generated against the G93A SOD1 mutant, it also recognized other SOD1 mutants. In human autopsy tissues from patients carrying SOD1 mutations, C4F6 identified skein-like intracellular inclusions in motor neurons, similar to those seen in rodents, and again stained only a subset of motor neurons. In spinal cords from patients with sporadic ALS, other neurodegenerative diseases, and normal controls, C4F6-immunoreactive inclusions were not detected, but the antibody did reveal diffuse immunostaining of some spinal motor neurons. The ability of C4F6 to differentiate pathologically affected tissue in mutant SOD1 ALS rodent models and humans, specifically motor neuron populations, suggests that this antibody may recognize a "toxic" form of the mutant SOD1 protein.},

abstract = {Several missense mutations in the coding region of angiogenin (ANG) gene have been identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. These mutations lead to loss of either ribonucleolytic activity or nuclear translocation activity or both of ANG (protein encoded by ANG gene) causing ALS. We present here a cohesive and comprehensive picture of the molecular origins of functional loss of all ALS associated ANG mutants, emerging via extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Our method effectively predicts that conformational change of His114 results in loss of ribonucleolytic activity and that reduction of solvent accessible surface area of nuclear localization signal residues (31)RRR(33) results in loss of nuclear translocation activity. These predictions hold true, without exception, for all ANG mutants studied and can be employed to infer whether a new ANG mutation is causative of ALS or benign ahead of experimental findings.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease, and the most common in European populations. Results of genetic analysis and mutation screening of SOD1 in a cohort of 60 Iranian ALS patients are here reported. Initially, linkage analysis in 4 families identified a disease-linked locus that included the known ALS gene, SOD1. Screening of SOD1 identified homozygous p.Asp90Ala causing mutations in all the linked families. Haplotype analysis suggests that the p.Asp90Ala alleles in the Iranian patients might share a common founder with the renowned Scandinavian recessive p.Asp90Ala allele. Subsequent screening in all the patients resulted in identification of 3 other mutations in SOD1, including p.Leu84Phe in the homozygous state. Phenotypic features of the mutation-bearing patients are presented. SOD1 mutations were found in 11.7{\%} of the cohort, 38.5{\%} of the familial ALS probands, and 4.25{\%} of the sporadic ALS cases. SOD1 mutations contribute significantly to ALS among Iranians.},

abstract = {Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Superoxide dismutase-1 mutations decrease protein stability and promote aggregation. The mutant monomer is thought to be an intermediate in the pathway from the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer to aggregate. Here we find that the monomeric copper-apo, zinc-holo protein is structurally perturbed and the apo-protein aggregates without reattainment of the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Intervention to stabilize the superoxide dismutase-1 dimer and inhibit aggregation is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy. We describe protein-ligand interactions for two compounds, Isoproterenol and 5-fluorouridine, highlighted as superoxide dismutase-1 stabilizers. We find both compounds interact with superoxide dismutase-1 at a key region identified at the core of the superoxide dismutase-1 fibrillar aggregates, $\beta$-barrel loop II-strand 3, rather than the proposed dimer interface site. This illustrates the need for direct structural observations when developing compounds for protein-targeted therapeutics.},

abstract = {Recently, mutations in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease involving motor neuron loss, paralysis and death. It is mainly due to protein misfolding and aggregation resulting from the enhanced peroxidase activity of SOD1 mutants. In this study, we have carried out a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation for wild type (WT), H43R and W32F mutated SOD1's dimer and compared their structure and conformational properties by extracting several quantitative properties from the trajectory to understand the pathology of fALS disease. Our results show considerable differences in H43R compared to WT and W32F mutated SOD1, such as increasing distances between the critical residues results in open conformation at the active site, strong fluctuations in the important loops (Zinc and electrostatic loops) and weakening of important hydrogen bonds especially between N (His 43/Arg 43) and carbonyl oxygen (His 120) in agreement with the experimental report. The calculated buried surface area of dimer interface for WT, H43R and W32F are 682, 726 and 657 {\AA}(2) respectively, representing the loss of dimerization in H43R. Essential dynamics reveal that overall motions of WT and W32F are mainly involved in three to four eigenvectors, but in H43R the overall motions are mainly in the first eigenvector. These data thus provide a unifying description for the structural destabilization, enhanced peroxidase activity, loss of dismutation activity and increase in aggregation propensity in the pathology of fALS diseases.},

abstract = {Protein crystallization is frequently induced by the addition of various precipitants, which directly affect protein solubility. In addition to organic cosolvents and long-chain polymers, salts belong to the most widely used precipitants in protein crystallography. However, despite such widespread usage, their mode of action at the atomistic level is still largely unknown. Here, we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the villin headpiece crystal unit cell to examine its stability at different concentrations of sodium sulfate. We show that the inclusion of ions in crystal solvent at high concentration can prevent large rearrangements of the asymmetric units and a loss of symmetry of the unit cell without significantly affecting protein dynamics. Of importance, a similar result can be achieved by neutralizing several specific charged residues suggesting that they may play an active role in crystal destabilization due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions. Our results provide a microscopic picture behind salt-induced stabilization of a protein crystal and further suggest that adequate modeling of realistic crystallization conditions may be necessary for successful molecular dynamics simulations of protein crystals.},

Here, we have combined reprogramming and stem cell differentiation approaches with genome engineering and RNA sequencing to define the transcriptional and functional changes that are induced in human motor neurons by mutant SOD1. Mutant SOD1 protein induced a transcriptional signature indicative of increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial function, altered subcellular transport, and activation of the ER stress and unfolded protein response pathways. Functional studies demonstrated that these pathways were perturbed in a manner dependent on the SOD1 mutation. Finally, interrogation of stem-cell-derived motor neurons produced from ALS patients harboring a repeat expansion in C9orf72 indicates that at least a subset of these changes are more broadly conserved in ALS.},

abstract = {Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis induce misfolding and aggregation of the protein with the inherent propensity of mutant SOD1 to aggregate generally correlating, with a few exceptions, to the duration of illness in patients with the same mutation. One notable exception was the D101N variant, which has been described as wild-type-like. The D101N mutation is associated with rapidly progressing motor neuron degeneration but shows a low propensity to aggregate. By assaying the kinetics of aggregation in a well-characterized cultured cell model, we show that the D101N mutant is slower to initiate aggregation than the D101G mutant. In this cell system of protein over-expression, both mutants were equally less able to acquire Zn than WT SOD1. In addition, both of these mutants were equivalently less able to fold into the trypsin-resistant conformation that characterizes WT SOD1. A second major difference between the two mutants was that the D101N variant more efficiently formed a normal intramolecular disulfide bond. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the D101N and D101G variants exhibit clearly distinctive features, including a different rate of aggregation, and yet both are associated with rapidly progressing disease. We sought to better characterize the biochemical features of two SOD1 mutants associated with rapidly progressing disease, the D101G and wild-type like D101N mutants. We observed using our cell model that that although similarities were observed when comparing the ability to bind metals and resist trypsin digestion, these mutants differed in their ability to initiate aggregation and to form the normal intramolecular disulfide bond. We conclude that these mutants exhibit distinct properties despite producing similar disease phenotypes in patients.},

Using induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) from patients with mutation in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, we show that spinal MNs, but rarely non-MNs, exhibited neurofilament (NF) aggregation followed by neurite degeneration when glia were not present. These changes were associated with decreased stability of NF-L mRNA and binding of its 3' UTR by mutant SOD1 and thus altered protein proportion of NF subunits. Such MN-selective changes were mimicked by expression of a single copy of the mutant SOD1 in human embryonic stem cells and were prevented by genetic correction of the SOD1 mutation in patient's iPSCs. Importantly, conditional expression of NF-L in the SOD1 iPSC-derived MNs corrected the NF subunit proportion, mitigating NF aggregation and neurite degeneration. Thus, NF misregulation underlies mutant SOD1-mediated NF aggregation and axonal degeneration in ALS MNs.},

Accurate disease modeling, identifying disease mechanisms, and developing therapeutics is urgently needed.

We now report a rapid, highly reproducible method to convert adult human fibroblasts from living ALS patients to induced neuronal progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation into astrocytes (i-astrocytes). Non-cell autonomous toxicity to motor neurons is found following coculture of i-astrocytes from familial ALS patients with mutation in superoxide dismutase or hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 (ORF 72 on chromosome 9) the two most frequent causes of ALS. Remarkably, i-astrocytes from sporadic ALS patients are as toxic as those with causative mutations, suggesting a common mechanism. Easy production and expansion of i-astrocytes now enables rapid disease modeling and high-throughput drug screening to alleviate astrocyte-derived toxicity.},

abstract = {ALS is a terminal disease of motor neurons that is characterized by accumulation of proteinaceous deposits in affected cells. Pathological deposition of mutated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) accounts for ∼20{\%} of the familial ALS (fALS) cases. However, understanding the molecular link between mutation and disease has been difficult, given that more than 140 different SOD1 mutants have been observed in fALS patients. In addition, the molecular origin of sporadic ALS (sALS) is unclear. By dissecting the amino acid sequence of SOD1, we identified four short segments with a high propensity for amyloid fibril formation. We find that fALS mutations in these segments do not reduce their propensity to form fibrils. The atomic structures of two fibril-forming segments from the C terminus, (101)DSVISLS(107) and (147)GVIGIAQ(153), reveal tightly packed $\beta$-sheets with steric zipper interfaces characteristic of the amyloid state. Based on these structures, we conclude that both C-terminal segments are likely to form aggregates if available for interaction. Proline substitutions in (101)DSVISLS(107) and (147)GVIGIAQ(153) impaired nucleation and fibril growth of full-length protein, confirming that these segments participate in aggregate formation. Our hypothesis is that improper protein maturation and incompletely folded states that render these aggregation-prone segments available for interaction offer a common molecular pathway for sALS and fALS.},

abstract = {Disruptions in metal ion homeostasis have been described in association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for a number of years but the precise mechanism of involvement is poorly understood. Metal ions are especially important to familial ALS cases caused by mutations in the metalloenzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). To investigate the role of metals in aggregation of mutant SOD1, we have examined the localization of metal ions in a cell culture model of overexpression. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were transfected to overexpress SOD1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to readily identify the transfected cells and the intracellular aggregates that develop in the cells expressing mutant or wild-type (WT) SOD1. The concentration and distribution of iron, copper, and zinc were determined for four SOD1 mutants (A4V, G37R, H80R, and D125H) as well as a WT SOD1 using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). Results demonstrated that the SOD1 aggregates were metal-deficient within the cells, which is consistent with recent in vitro studies. In addition, all SOD1 mutants showed significantly decreased copper content compared to the WT SOD1 cells, regardless of the mutant's ability to bind copper. These results suggest that SOD1 overexpression creates an unmet demand on the cell for copper. This is particularly true for the SOD1 mutants where copper delivery may also be impaired. Hence, the SOD1 mutants are less stable than WT SOD1 and if copper is limited, aggregate formation of the metal-deficient, mutant SOD1 protein occurs.},

abstract = {‘Prion-like propagation' has recently been proposed for disease spread in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-linked familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pathological SOD1 conformers are presumed to propagate via cell-to-cell transmission. In this model, the risk-based kinetics of neuronal cell loss over time appears to be represented by a sigmoidal function that reflects the kinetics of intercellular transmission. Here, we describe an alternative view of prion-like propagation in SOD1-linked ALS−its relation to disease prognosis under the protective-aggregation hypothesis. Nucleation-dependent polymerization has been widely accepted as the molecular mechanism of prion propagation. If toxic species of misfolded SOD1, as soluble oligomers, are formed as on-pathway intermediates of nucleation-dependent polymerization, further fibril extension via sequential addition of monomeric mutant SOD1 would be protective against neurodegeneration. This is because the concentration of unfolded mutant SOD1 monomers, which serve as precursor of nucleation and toxic species of mutant SOD1, would decline in proportion to the extent of aggregation. The nucleation process requires that native conformers exist in an unfolded state that may result from escaping the cellular protein quality control machinery. However, prion-like propagation−SOD1 aggregated form self-propagates by imposing its altered conformation on normal SOD1−appears to antagonize the protective role of aggregate growth. The cross-seeding reaction with normal SOD1 would lead to a failure to reduce the concentration of unfolded mutant SOD1 monomers, resulting in continuous nucleation and subsequent generation of toxic species, and influence disease prognosis. In this alternative view, the kinetics of neuronal loss appears to be represented by an exponential function, with decreasing risk reflecting the protective role of aggregate and the potential for cross-seeding reactions between mutant SOD1 and normal SOD1.},

abstract = {Understanding factors controlling the introduction and spread of species is crucial to improving the management of both natural populations and introduced species. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is considered the most aggressive freshwater invader in the Northern Hemisphere, and is a convenient model system for invasion biology, offering one of the best aquatic examples for examining the invasion process. We used data on 553 of the 1040 glacial lakes in the Republic of Belarus that were examined for the presence of zebra mussels. We used these data to build, test, and construct modified models to predict the spread of this invader, including selection of important parameters that could limit the spread of this invader. In spite of 200 years of continuous invasion, by 1996, zebra mussels were found in only 16.8{\%} of all lakes studied. Of those lakes without zebra mussels in 1996, 66{\%} were predicted to be susceptible to invasion by zebra mussels in the future, and 33{\%} were predicted to be immune to ...},

abstract = {A $\beta$-sheet cytosolic enzymatic protein, [Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1, (Cu-Zn SOD1)] not only neutralize the superoxide radical but also catalyses their disproportionation into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The structure and activity of SOD1 protein depends on two important loops viz., Zn-binding and Electrostatic loop [E-loop]. In this work, the electrostatic loop of SOD1 protein in native and mutated states with single point mutation on the loop viz., D124V, D125H {\&} S134N are subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for the period of 50,000 ps. The mutated E-loops are docked with four different chemical compounds viz., 5-Fluorouridine, Isoproteranol, 4-(4-methyl-1, 4-diazepan-1-yl)-2-(trifluromethyl) quinazoline and Uridine-5- Monophosphate. The structures with larger binding affinity are again subjected to molecular dynamics simulation for the period of 50,000 ps. The structure and electrostatic properties of mutated E-loops before and after interacting with chemical compounds are compared with the E-loop in native state. It is found that the chemical compounds, reduce the effect of mutated E-loop in SOD1 protein by reorienting the mutated E-loops in such a way that they exhibit structural and electrostatic properties close to E-loop of native state. Among the different chemical compounds of interest, Uridine-5-monophosphate is found to exhibit better interaction, which helps to reduce the rapid aggregation of SOD1 protein due to Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [FALS] mutations. The molecular dynamics simulation for mutated E-loops generate an ensemble of configurations, the conformational sampling in these configurations are examined by the Free energy profile.},

abstract = {The main objective of this work is to determine the mechanism for misfolding and aggregation as a result of mutations in Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase1. The quantum mechanical approach is beneficial for investigating the early stages of mutation, misfolding, and loss of protection of the native structures involved in the neuro-degeneration disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. All the structures were optimized using density functional theory (B3LYP) with 6-31G* and LANL2DZ basis sets. The binding energies of the metal ions with their associated residues in the active site loop and metal binding loop have been investigated for native and metal-bound mutated structures. The metal ion affinity (MIA) was computed for all the structures. The binding energy and MIA in gas phase reveal the nature of interaction of active site residues with the metal cations. The electronic effect prevailing between the side chains of the residues in the active site governing the intermolecular interactions is given by the polarizability studies. The role of the bridging residue His 63 in the active site of the protein in the native and metal-bound mutated structures have been studied using ONIOM method to reveal the changes that takes place in the structural parameters during mutation. The molecular dynamics simulation is used to explore different dynamic properties of active site in native and metal-bound mutated structures. The structural information provided by the molecular dynamics simulation illustrates the structural consequences in the mutated structures.},

abstract = {Neglected for years, astrocytes are now recognized to fulfill and support many, if not all, homeostatic functions of the healthy central nervous system (CNS). During neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injury (SCI), astrocytes in the vicinity of degenerating areas undergo both morphological and functional changes that might compromise their intrinsic properties. Evidence from human and animal studies show that deficient astrocyte functions or loss-of-astrocytes largely contribute to increased susceptibility to cell death for neurons, oligodendrocytes and axons during ALS and SCI disease progression. Despite exciting advances in experimental CNS repair, most of current approaches that are translated into clinical trials focus on the replacement or support of spinal neurons through stem cell transplantation, while none focus on the specific replacement of astroglial populations. Knowing the important functions carried out by astrocytes in the CNS, astrocyte replacement-based therapies might be a promising approach to alleviate overall astrocyte dysfunction, deliver neurotrophic support to degenerating spinal tissue and stimulate endogenous CNS repair abilities. Enclosed in this review, we gathered experimental evidence that argue in favor of astrocyte transplantation during ALS and SCI. Based on their intrinsic properties and according to the cell type transplanted, astrocyte precursors or stem cell-derived astrocytes promote axonal growth, support mechanisms and cells involved in myelination, are able to modulate the host immune response, deliver neurotrophic factors and provide protective molecules against oxidative or excitotoxic insults, amongst many possible benefits. Embryonic or adult stem cells can even be genetically engineered in order to deliver missing gene products and therefore maximize the chance of neuroprotection and functional recovery. However, before broad clinical translation, further preclinical data on safety, reliability and therapeutic efficiency should be collected. Although several technical challenges need to be overcome, we discuss the major hurdles that have already been met or solved by targeting the astrocyte population in experimental ALS and SCI models and we discuss avenues for future directions based on latest molecular findings regarding astrocyte biology.},
